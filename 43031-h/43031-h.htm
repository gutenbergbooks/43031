<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The Journal of George Fox is one of the great
religious autobiographies, and has its place with the
"Confessions" of St. Augustine, Saint Teresa's
"Life," Bunyan's "Grace Abounding to the Chief
of Sinners," the "Life of Madam Guyon, Written by
Herself," and John Wesley's "Journal." The great
interest which has developed in recent years
in the Psychology of Religion, and in the
study of mysticism, has most naturally given
new interest and prominence to all autobiographical
writings which lay bare the inward
states and processes of the seeking, or the triumphant
soul. Professor William James has stated
a well-known fact when he says that religion must be
studied in those individuals in whom it is manifested
to an extra-normal degree. In other words, we must
go to those individuals who have a genius for religion&mdash;for
whom religion has constituted well nigh the
whole of life. George Fox is eminently a character
of this sort, as nearly every recent student of personal
religion has recognized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, again, his Journal is one of the best sources
in existence for the historical study of the inner life
of the Commonwealth and Restoration periods.
There were few hamlets so obscure, few villages so remote
that they did not have their streets traversed by
this strange man in leather who always travelled with
his eyes open. He knew all the sects and shades of
religion which flourished in these prolific times. He
never rides far without having some experience
which shows the spirit and tendencies of the epoch.
He never writes for effect, and he would have failed
if he had tried, but he has, though utterly unconscious
of it himself, filled his pages with the homely
stuff out of which the common life of his England
was made.</p>

<p>The world-events which moved rapidly across the
stage during the crowded years of his activity
receive but scant description from his pen. They are
never told for themselves. They come in as by-products
of a narrative, whose main purpose is the
story of personal inward experience. The camera
is set for a definite object, but it catches the whole
background with it. So here we have the picture
of a sensitive soul, bent singly and solely on following
a Divine Voice, yet its tasks are done, not in a
desert, but in the setting of great historic events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Here are the soldiers of Marston Moor and Dunbar;
Cromwell and his household; Desborough
and Monk; the quartering of regicides and
the "new era" under the second Charles. At every
point we have vivid scenes in courts, in
prisons, in churches, and in inns. People of
all classes and sorts talk in their natural
tongue in these pages. Fox has little dramatic
power, but everything which furthers, or hinders his
earthly mission interests him and gets caught in his
narrative. Pepys and Evelyn have readier pens, but
Fox had many points of contact with the England of
those days which they lacked.</p>

<p>In its original, unabridged form, the Journal contains
many epistles, and long, arid passages which are
somewhat forbidding, and it has always required a
patient, faithful reader. It has, however, always had
a circle of readers outside the religious body which
was founded by George Fox. This circle has
been composed of those who were somewhat
kindred in spirit with him, and the circle has
kept small, mainly owing to the inherent difficulties
of the ponderous, unedited mass of material. Of the
Journal, in its complete form, there have nevertheless
been thirteen editions published&mdash;nine in England
and four in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The present editor has undertaken the task of
abridging and editing it, in the belief that the time is
ripe for such a work. The parts of the Journal which
have been omitted&mdash;and they are many&mdash;have gone
because they possess no living, present interest, or
because they were repetitions of what is left. The
story, as it stands, is continuous, and in no way
suffers by omissions. The writer of the Journal
lacked perspective. Everything that came was
equally important, and his first editors, in 1694,
looked upon these writings as too precious and sacred
to be tampered with or seriously condensed. The
original manuscript, which has never been published
(now in the possession of Charles James Spence,
of North Shields, England), shows us that the little
group of early editors contented themselves with
improving the diction, introducing some system
into the spelling, and cutting out an occasional anecdote
which they feared might startle the sober
reader. The original manuscript is a little livelier,
fresher and more graphic than any published edition,
though in the main we have in the editions a faithful
reproduction of what Fox wrote.</p>

<p>The notes which attend the text in this edition
have seemed necessary for a clear understanding of
the passages to which they refer. They have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
made as brief and as few in number as the situation
would warrant. The Introduction is an attempt to
put George Fox in his historical setting, and to
develop the central ideas which he expounded,
though all points of detail are postponed to
the notes. This estimate of his religious message
is based on a study of the body of
his writings, which are voluminous, and on
the writings of his contemporaries and fellow-laborers.
It is a pleasure for the editor to acknowledge
the valuable assistance which he has received
from his friends, Norman Penney, John Wilhelm
Rowntree, Joshua Rowntree and Prof. Allen C.
Thomas.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>There are mysterious moments in the early life
of the individual which we call "budding periods."
They are incubation crises, when some new power or
function is coming into being. The budding tendency
to creep, to walk, to imitate, or to speak, is an
indication that the psychological moment has come
for learning the special operation.</p>

<p>There are, too, similar periods in the history of
the race, mysterious times of gestation, when something
new is coming to be, however dimly the age
itself comprehends the significance of its travail.
These racial "budding periods," like those others,
have organic connection with the past. They are life-events
which the previous history of humanity has
made possible, and so they cannot be understood by
themselves.</p>

<p>The most notable characteristic of such times is
the simultaneous outbreaking of new aspects of truth
in sundered places and through diverse lives, as
though the breath of a new Pentecost were abroad.
This dawning time is generally followed by the
appearance of some person who proves to be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
be the exponent of what others have dimly or subconsciously
felt, and yet could not explicitly set forth.
Such a person becomes by a certain divine right the
prophet of the period because he knows how to interpret
its ideas with such compelling force that he
organizes men, either for action or for perpetuating
the truth.</p>

<p>In the life history of the Anglo-Saxon people few
periods are more significant than that which is commonly
called the Commonwealth period, though the
term must be used loosely to cover the span from
1640 to 1660. It was in high degree one of these
incubation epochs when something new came to
consciousness, and things equally new came to deed.
This is not the place to describe the political struggles
which finally produced tremendous constitutional
changes, nor to tell how those who formed the
pith and marrow of a nation rose against an antiquated
conception of kingship and established principles
of self-government. The civil and political commotion
was the outcome of a still deeper commotion.
For a century the burning questions had been
religious questions. The Church of that time
was the result of compromise. It had inherited
a large stock of mediæval thought, and
had absorbed a mass of mediæval traditions. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
men of moral and religious earnestness were bent
on some measure of fresh reform. A spirit was
abroad which could not be put down, and which
would not be quiet. The old idea of an authoritative
Church was outgrown, and yet no religious system
had come in its place which provided for a free personal
approach to God Himself. It has, in fact,
always been a peculiarly difficult problem to discover
some form of organization which will conserve the
inherited truth and guarantee the stability of the
whole, while at the same time it promotes the personal
freedom of the individual.</p>

<p>The long struggle for religious reforms in England
followed two lines of development. There was
on the one hand a well-defined movement toward
Presbyterianism, and on the other a somewhat
chaotic search for freer religious life&mdash;a movement
towards Independency. The rapid spread of Presbyterianism
increased rather than diminished the
general religious commotion. It soon became clear
that this was another form of ecclesiastical authority,
as inflexible as the old, and lacking the sacred sanction
of custom. Then, too, the Calvinistic theology
of the time did violence to human nature as a whole.
Its linked logic might compel intellectual assent, but
there is something in a man as real as his intellect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
which is not satisfied with this clamping of eternal
truth into inflexible propositions. Personal soul-hunger,
and the necessity which many individuals feel
for spiritual quest, must always be reckoned with. It
should not be forgotten that George Fox came to his
spiritual crisis under this theology.</p>

<p>Thus while theology was stiffening into fixed form
with one group, it was becoming ever more
fluid among great masses of people throughout
the nation. Religious authority ceased to
count as it had in the past. Existing religious
conditions were no longer accepted as
final. There was a widespread restlessness which
gradually produced a host of curious sects. Fox
came directly in contact with at least four of the
leading sectarian movements of the time and there
can be no question that they exerted an influence
upon him both positively and negatively. The first
"sect" in importance, and the first to touch the life
of George Fox, was the Baptist&mdash;at that time often
called Anabaptist. His uncle Pickering was a member
of this sect, and, though George seems to have
been rather afraid of the Baptists, he must have
learned something from them. They already had a
long history, reaching back on the continent to the
time of Luther, and their entire career had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
marked by persecution and suffering. They were
"Independents," i. e., they believed that Church and
State should be separate, and that each local church
should have its own independent life. They stoutly
objected to infant baptism, maintaining that no act
could have a religious value unless it were an act
of will and of faith. Edwards, in his "Gangræna,"
1646, reports a doctrine then afloat to the intent that
"it is as lawful to baptize a cat, or a dog, or a chicken
as to baptize an infant." Their views on ministry
were novel and must surely have interested Fox.
They encouraged a lay ministry, and they actually
had cobblers, leather-sellers, tailors, weavers and at
least one brewer, preaching in their meetings. John
Bunyan, who was of them, proved to general satisfaction
that "Oxford and Cambridge were not necessary
to fit men to preach." Still stranger, they
had what their enemies scornfully called "She-preachers."
Edwards has recorded this dreadful error
in his list of one hundred and ninety-nine "distinct
errors, heresies and blasphemies": "Some say
that 'tis lawful for women to preach, that they have
gifts as well as men; and some of them do actually
preach, having great resort to them"!</p>

<p>Furthermore, they held that all tithes and all set
stipends were unlawful. They maintained that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
preachers should work with their own hands and not
"go in black clothes." This sad error appears in Edwards's
chaotic list: "It is said that all settled certain
maintenance for ministers of the gospel is unlawful."
Finally many of the Baptists opposed the use
of "steeple houses" and held the view that no person
is fitted to preach or prophesy <em>unless the Spirit
moves him</em>.</p>

<p>The "Seekers" are occasionally mentioned in the
Journal and were widely scattered throughout England
during the Commonwealth. They were serious-minded
people who saw nowhere in the world any
adequate embodiment of religion. They held that
there was no true Church, and that there had been
none since the days of the apostles. They did not
celebrate any sacraments, for they held that there
was nobody in the world who possessed an anointing
clearly, certainly and infallibly enough to perform
such rites. They had no "heads" to their assemblies,
for they had none among them who had "the
power or the gift to go before one another in the
way of eminency or authority." William Penn says
that they met together "not in their own wills" and
"waited together in silence, and as anything arose in
one of their minds that they thought favored with
a divine spring, so they sometimes spoke."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>We are able to pick out a few of their characteristic
"errors" from Edwards's list in the "Gangræna."
"That to read the Scriptures to a mixed
congregation is dangerous." "That we did look for
great matters from One crucified in Jerusalem 1600
years ago, but that does no good; it must be a Christ
formed <em>in</em> us." "That men ought to preach and exercise
their gifts without study and premeditation
and not to think what they are to say till they speak,
because it shall be given them in that hour and the
Spirit shall teach them." "That there is no need
of human learning or reading of authors for preachers,
but all books and learning must go down. It
comes from want of the Spirit that men write such
great volumes."</p>

<p>The "Seekers" expected that the light was soon
to break, the days of apostasy would end and the
Spirit would make new revelations. In the light of
this expectation a peculiar significance attaches to
the frequent assertion of Fox that he and his followers
were living in the same Spirit which gave forth
the Scriptures, and received direct commands as did
the apostles. "I told him," says Fox of a "priest,"
"that to receive and go with a message, and to have
a word from the Lord, as the prophets and apostles
had and did, and as <em>I had done</em>," was quite another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thing from ordinary experience. A much more chaotic
"sect" was that of the "Ranters." There was
probably a small seed of truth in their doctrines, but
under the excitement of religious enthusiasm they
went to wild and perilous extremes, and in some
cases even fell over the edge of sanity. They started
with the belief that God is in everything, that every
man is a manifestation of God, and they ended with
the conclusion which their bad logic gave them that
<em>therefore what the man does God does</em>. They were
above all authority and actually said: "Have not <em>we</em>
the Spirit, and why may not <em>we</em> write scriptures as
well as Paul?" They believed the Scriptures "not
because such and such writ it," but because they
could affirm "God saith so in me." What Christ did
was for them only a temporal figure, and nothing external
was of consequence, since they had God Himself
in them. As the law had been fulfilled they held
that they were free from all law, and might without
sin do what they were prompted to do. Richard
Baxter says that "the horrid villainies of the sect did
speedily extinguish it." Judge Hotham told Fox
in 1651 that "if God had not raised up the principle
of Light and life which he (Fox) preached, the
nation had been overrun with Ranterism." Many of
the Ranters became Friends, some of them becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
substantial persons in the new Society, though there
were for a time some serious Ranter influences at
work within the Society, and a strenuous opposition
was made to the establishment of discipline, order
and system. The uprising of the "Fifth-monarchy
men" is the only other movement which calls for
special allusion. They were literal interpreters of
Scripture, and had discovered grounds for believing
in the near approach of the millennium. By some
system of calculation they had concluded that the
last of the four world monarchies&mdash;the Assyrian,
Persian, Greek and Roman&mdash;was tottering toward
its fall, and the Fifth universal monarchy&mdash;Christ's&mdash;was
about to be set up. The saints were to reign.
The new monarchy was so slow in coming that they
thought they might hasten it with carnal weapons.
Perhaps a miracle would be granted if they acted on
their faith. The miracle did not come, but the uprising
brought serious trouble to Fox, who had before
told these visionaries in beautifully plain language
that "Christ <em>has</em> come and has dashed to
pieces the four monarchies."</p>

<p>The person of genius discovers in the great mass
of things about him just that which is vital and essential.
He seizes the eternal in the temporal, and
all that he borrows, he fuses with creative power into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a new whole. This creative power belonged to
George Fox. There was hardly a single truth in the
Quaker message which had not been held by some
one of the many sects of the time. He saw the spiritual
and eternal element which was almost
lost in the chaos of half truths and errors. In
his message these scattered truths and ideas were
fused into a new whole and received new life from
his living central idea.</p>

<p>It is a strange fact that, though England had
been facing religious problems of a most complex
sort since the oncoming of the Reformation,
it had produced no religious genius. No
one had appeared who saw truth on a new level,
or who possessed a personality and a personal message
which compelled the attention of the nation.
There had been long years of ingenious, patchwork
compromise, but no distinct prophet. George Fox
is the first real prophet of the English Reformation,
for he saw what was involved in this great religious
movement.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Perhaps the most convincing proof of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
this is not the remarkable immediate results of his
labors, though these are significant enough, but
rather the easily-verified fact that the progress of
religious truth during the last hundred years has
been toward the truth which he made central in his
message.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> However his age misunderstood him, he
would to-day find a goodly fellowship of believers.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to have him tell his
own story, which in the main he knows how to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
It will, however, be of some service to the reader to
develop in advance the principle of which he was the
exponent. The first period of his life is occupied
with a most painful quest for something which would
satisfy his heart. His celebrated contemporary,
Bunyan, possessed much greater power of describing
inward states and experiences, but one is led to
believe on comparing the two autobiographical
passages that the sufferings of Fox, in his years of
spiritual desolation, were even more severe than were
those of Bunyan, though it is to be noted that the
former does not suffer from the awful sense of personal
sin as the latter does. "When I came to eleven
years of age, <em>I knew pureness and righteousness</em>," is
Fox's report of his own early deliverance from the
sense of sin. His "despair," from which he could find
no comfort, was caused by the extreme sensitiveness
of his soul. The discovery that the world, and even
the Church, was full of wickedness and sin crushed
him. "I looked upon the great professors of the
city [London, 1643], and I saw all was dark and
under the chain of darkness." This settled upon him
with a weight, deep almost as death. Nothing in the
whole world seemed to him so real as the world's
wickedness. "I could have wished," he cries out, "I
had never been born, or that I had been born blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that I might never have seen wickedness or vanity;
and deaf that I might never have heard vain and
wicked words, or the Lord's name blasphemed."</p>

<p>He was overwhelmed, however, not merely
because he discovered that the world was wicked, but
much more because he discovered that priests were
"empty hollow casks," and that religion, as far as
he could discover any in England, was weak and ineffective,
with no dynamic message which moved
with the living power of God behind it. He could
find theology enough and theories enough, but he
missed everywhere the direct evidence that men
about him had found God. Religion seemed to him
to be reduced to a system of clever substitutes for
God, while his own soul could not rest until it found
the Life itself.</p>

<p>The turning point of his life is the discovery&mdash;through
what he beautifully calls an "opening"&mdash;that
Christ is not merely an historic person who once
came to the world and then forever withdrew, but
that He is the continuous Divine Presence, God
manifested humanly, and that this Christ can
"speak to his condition."</p>

<p>At first sight, there appears to be nothing
epoch-making in these simple words. But it
soon develops that what he really means is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that he has discovered within the deeps of
his own personality a meeting place of the human
spirit with the Divine Spirit. He had never had any
doubts about the historical Christ. All that the
Christians of his time believed <em>about</em> Christ, he, too,
believed. His long search had not been to find out
something <em>about</em> Christ, but to find <em>Him</em>. The
Christ of the theological systems was too remote and
unreal to be dynamic for him. Assent to all the
propositions about Him left one still in the power
of sin. He emerges from the struggle with an absolute
certainty in his own mind that he has discovered
a way by which his soul has immediate dealings
with the living God. The larger truth involved in
his experience soon becomes plain to him, namely,
that he has found a universal principle, that
the Spirit of God reaches every man. He finds
this divine-human relation taught everywhere in
Scripture, but he challenges everybody to find
the primary evidence of it in his own consciousness.
He points out that every hunger of the
heart, every dissatisfaction with self, every act of
self-condemnation, every sense of shortcoming shows
that the soul is not unvisited by the Divine Spirit,
To want God at all implies some acquaintance with
Him. The ability to appreciate the right, to discriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
light from darkness, the possibility of being
anything more than a creature of sense, living for
the moment, means that our personal life is in contact
at some point with the Infinite Life, and that all
things are possible to him who believes and obeys.</p>

<p>To all sorts and conditions of men, Fox continually
makes appeal to "that of God" within them. At
other times he calls it indiscriminately the "Light,"
or the "Seed," or the "Principle" of God within
the man. Frequently it is the "Christ within." In
every instance he means that the Divine Being operates
directly upon the human life, and the new
birth, the real spiritual life, begins when the individual
becomes aware of Him and sets himself to
obey Him. He may have been living along with no
more explicit consciousness of a Divine presence
than the bubble has of the ocean on which it rests
and out of which it came; but even so, God is as near
him as is the beating of his own heart, and only needs
to be found and obeyed.</p>

<p>Instead of making him undervalue the historic
revelations of God, the discovery of this principle
of truth gave him a new insight into the revelations
of the past and the supreme manifestations of the
Divine Life and Love. He could interpret his own
inward experience in the light of the gathered revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the ages. His contemporaries used to say
that, though the Bible were lost, it might be found
in the mouth of George Fox, and there is not a line
in the Journal to indicate that he undervalued either
the Holy Scriptures or the historic work of Christ
for human salvation. Entirely the contrary. As soon
as he realized that the same God who spoke directly to
men in earlier ages still speaks directly, and that
to be a man means to have a "seed of God"
within, he saw that there were no limits to the possibilities
of a human life. It becomes possible to live
entirely in the power of the Spirit and to have one's
life made a free and victorious spiritual life. So to
live is to be a "man"&mdash;for sin and disobedience reduce
a man. The normal person, then, is the one who
has discovered the infinite Divine resources, and is
turning them into the actual stuff of a human life.
That it happens now and then is no mystery; that it
happens so seldom is the real mystery. "I asked them
if they were living in the power of the Spirit that
gave forth the Scriptures" is his frequent and somewhat
naïve question, as though everybody ought to
be doing it.</p>

<p>The consciousness of the presence of God is the
characteristic thing in George Fox's religious life.
His own life is in immediate contact with the Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Life. It is this conviction which unifies and gives
direction to all his activities. God has found him
and he has found God. It is this experience which
puts him among the mystics.</p>

<p>But here we must not overlook the distinction in
types of mysticism. There is a great group of
mystics who have painfully striven to find God by a
path of negation. They believe that everything
finite is a shadow, an illusion&mdash;nothing real. To
find God, then, every vestige of the finite must be
given up. The infinite can be reached only by wiping
out all marks of the finite. The Absolute can be
attained only when every "thing" and every
"thought" have been reduced to zero. But the difficulty
is that this kind of an Absolute becomes absolutely
unknowable. From the nature of the case He
could not be <em>found</em>, for to have any consciousness of
Him at all would be to have a finite and illusory
thought.</p>

<p>George Fox belongs rather among the <em>positive</em>
mystics, who seek to realize the presence of God in
this finite human life. That He transcends all finite
experiences they fully realize, but the reality of any
finite experience lies just in this fact, that the living
God is in it and expresses some divine purpose
through it, so that a man may, as George Fox's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
friend, Isaac Penington says, "become an organ of
the life and power of God," and "progagate God's
life in the world." The mystic of this type may feel
the light break within him and know that God is
there, or he may equally well discover Him as he
performs some clear, plain duty which lies across his
path. His whole mystical insight is in his discovery
that God is near, and not beyond the reach of the
ladders which He has given us.</p>

<p>But no one has found the true George Fox when
he stops with an analysis of the views which he held.
Almost more remarkable than the truth which he
proclaimed was the fervor, the enthusiasm, the
glowing passion of the man. He was of the genuine
apostolic type. He had come through years of
despair over the wickedness of the world, but as soon
as the Light really broke, and he knew that he had
a message for the world in its sin and ignorance,
there was after that nothing but the grave
itself which could keep him quiet. He preached in
cathedrals, on hay stacks, on cliffs of rock, from hill
tops, under apple trees and elm trees, in barns and in
city squares, while he sent epistles from every prison
in which he was shut up. Wherever he could find
men who had souls to save he told them of the life
and Truth which he had found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether one is in sympathy with Fox's mystical
view of life or not, it is impossible not to be impressed
with the practical way in which he wrought
out his faith. After all, the view that God and man
are not isolated was not new; the really new thing
was the appearance of a man who genuinely practiced
the Divine presence and lived <em>as though he knew</em> that
his life was in a Divine environment.</p>

<p>We have dwelt upon the fundamental religious
principle of Fox at some length, because his great
work as a social reformer and as the organizer of a
new system of Church government proceeds from
this root principle. One central idea moves through
all he did. His originality lies, however, not so much
in the discovery, or the rediscovery, of the principle
as in the fearless application of it. Other men had
believed in Divine guidance; other Christians had proclaimed
the impenetration of God in the lives of men.
But George Fox had the courage to carry his conviction
to its logical conclusions. He knew that there
were difficulties entailed in calling men everywhere
to trust the Light and to follow the Voice, but he
believed that there were more serious difficulties to
be faced by those who put some external authority
in the place of the soul's own sight. He was ready for
the consequences and he proceeded to carry out both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in the social and in the religious life of his time the
experiment of obeying the Light within. It is this
courageous fidelity to his insight that made him a
social reformer and a religious organizer. He belongs,
in this respect, in the same list with St. Francis
of Assisi. They both attempted the difficult task of
bringing religion from heaven to earth.</p>

<p>1. In the light of his religious discovery Fox reinterpreted
man as a member of society. If man <em>has</em>
direct intercourse with God he is to be treated with
noble respect. He met the doctrine of the divine
right of kings with the conviction of the <em>divine right
of man</em>. Every man is to be treated as a man. He
was a <em>leveler</em>, but he leveled up, not down. Every
man was to be read in terms of his possibilities&mdash;if
not of royal descent, certainly of royal destiny.
This view made Fox an unparalleled optimist. He
believed that a mighty transformation would
come as soon as men were made aware of this divine
relationship which he had discovered. They would
go to living as he had done, in the <em>power</em> of this conviction.</p>

<p>He began at once to put in practice his principle of
equality&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, equality of privilege. He cut straight
through the elaborate web of social custom which
hid man's true nature from himself. Human life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
had become sicklied o'er with a cast of sham, until
man had half forgotten to act as <em>man</em>. Fox rejected
for himself every social custom which seemed to him
to be hollow and to belittle man himself. The honor
which belonged to God he would give to no man, and
the honor which belonged to any man he gave to
every man. This was the reason for his "thee" and
"thou." The plural form had been introduced to
give distinction. He would not use it. The Lord
Protector and the humble cotter were addressed
alike. He had an eye for the person of great gifts
and he never wished to reduce men to indistinguishable
atoms of society, but he was resolved to guard the
jewel of personality in every individual&mdash;man or
woman.</p>

<p>2. His estimate of the worth of man made him a
reformer. In society as he found it men were often
treated more as things than as persons. For petty offenses
they were hung,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and if they escaped this fate
they were put into prisons, where no touch of man's
humanity was in evidence. In the never-ending wars
the common people were hardly more than human
dice. Their worth as men was well nigh forgotten.
Trade was conducted on a system of sliding prices&mdash;high
for this man, low for some other. Dealers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
honest where they had to be; dishonest where they
could be. The courts of justice were extremely uncertain
and irregular, as the pages of this journal continually
show. Against every such crooked system
which failed to recognize the divine right of man
George Fox set himself. He himself had large opportunities
of observing the courts of justice and the
inhuman pens which by courtesy were called jails.
But he became a reformer, not to secure his own
rights or to get a better jail to lie in, but to establish
the principle of human rights for all men. He
went calmly to work to carry an out-and-out honesty
into all trade relations, to establish a fixed price
for goods of every sort, to make principles of business
square with principles of religion. By
voice or by epistle he called every judge in
the realm to "mind that of God" within him.
He refused ever to take an oath, because he
was resolved to make a plain man's "yea"
weigh as heavy as an oath. He was always in the
lists against the barbarity of the penal system, the
iniquity of enslaving men, the wickedness of war,
the wastefulness of fashion and the evils of drunkenness,
and by argument and deed he undertook to
lead the way to a new heroism, better than the heroism
of battlefields.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>3. The logic of his principle compelled him to
value education. If all men are to count as men,
it is a man's primal duty to be all he can be.
To be a poor organ of God when one was meant for
a good one belongs among the high sins.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> If it was
"opened" to him that Oxford and Cambridge could
not make men ministers, his own reason taught him
that it is not safe to call all men to obey the voice
and follow the light without broad-basing them at
the same time in the established facts of history and
nature. Fox himself very early set up schools for
boys and girls alike in which "everything civil and
useful in creation" was to be taught. It is, however,
quite possible that he undervalued the æsthetic side
of man, and that he suffered by his attempt to starve
it. In this particular he shared the puritan
tendency, and had not learned how to hold
all things in proportion, and to make the culture
of the senses at the same time beautify the inner
man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>4. On the distinctively religious side his discovery
of a direct divine-human relationship led to a
new interpretation of worship and ministry. God is
not far off. He needs no vicar, no person of any sort
between Himself and the worshipper. Grace no
more needs a special channel than the dew does.
There is no special holy place, as though God were
more <em>there</em> than <em>here</em>. He does not come from somewhere
else. He is Spirit, and needs only a responsive
soul, an open heart, to be <em>found</em>. Worship properly
begins when the soul discovers Him and enjoys His
presence&mdash;in the simplest words it is the soul's appreciation
of God. With his usual optimism, he believed
that all men and women were capable of this
stupendous attainment. He threw away all crutches
at the start and called upon everybody to walk
in the Spirit, to live in the Light. His house of worship
was bare of everything but seats. It had no
shrine, for the shekinah was to be in the hearts of
those who worshipped. It had no altar, for God
needed no appeasing, seeing that He Himself had
made the sacrifice for sin. It had no baptismal font,
for baptism was in his belief nothing short of immersion
into the life of the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit&mdash;a going down into the significance of Christ's
death and a coming up in newness of life with Him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
There was no communion table, because he believed
that the true communion consisted in partaking directly
of the soul's spiritual bread&mdash;the living
Christ. There were no confessionals, for in the silence,
with the noise and din of the outer life hushed,
the soul was to unveil itself to its Maker and let His
light lay bare its true condition. There was no organ
or choir, for each forgiven soul was to give praise
in the glad notes that were natural to it. No censer
was swung, for he believed God wanted only the fragrance
of sincere and prayerful spirits. There was
no priestly mitre, because each member of the true
Church was to be a priest unto God. No official
robes were in evidence, because the entire business
of life, in meeting and outside, was to be the putting
on of the white garments of a saintly life. From
beginning to end worship was the immediate appreciation
of God, and the appropriate activity of the
whole being in response to Him.</p>

<p>William Penn says of him: "The most awful, living,
reverent frame I ever felt or beheld was his in
prayer." And this was because he realized that he
was in the presence of God when he prayed. He believed
that the ministry of truth is limited to no
class of men and to no sex. As fast and as
far as any man discovers God it becomes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
business to make Him known to others. His
ability to do this effectively is a gift from
God, and makes him a minister. The only
thing the Church does is to recognize the gift. This
idea carried with it perfect freedom of utterance to
all who felt a <em>call</em> to speak, a principle which has
worked out better than the reader would guess,
though it has been often sorely tested.</p>

<p>In the Society which he founded there was no distinction
of clergy and laity. He undertook the difficult
task of organizing a Christian body on which
the priesthood of believers should be an actual fact,
and in which the ordinary religious exercises of the
Church should be under the directing and controlling
power of the Holy Spirit manifesting itself through
the congregation.</p>

<p>Not the least service of Fox to his age was the important
part which he took in breaking down the intolerable
doctrine of predestination, which hung like
an incubus over men's lives. It threw a gloom upon
every person who found himself forced by his logic
to believe it, and its effect upon sensitive souls was
simply dreadful. Fox met this doctrine with argument,
but he met it also with something better than
argument&mdash;he set over against it two facts: that
Divine grace and light are free, and that an inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
certainty of God's favor and acceptance is possible
for every believer. Wherever Quakerism went this
inward assurance went with it. The shadow of dread
uncertainty gave place to sunlight and joy. This was
the beginning of a spiritual emancipation which is
still growing, and peaceful faces and fragrant lives
are the result.</p>

<p>No reader of the Journal can fail to be impressed
with the fact that George Fox believed himself to be
an instrument for the manifestation of miraculous
power. Diseases were cured through him; he foretold
coming events; he often penetrated states and
conditions of mind and heart; he occasionally had a
sense of what was happening in distant parts, and he
himself underwent on at least three occasions striking
bodily changes, so that he seemed, for days at a
time, like one dead, and was in one of these times
incapable of being bled. These passages need trouble
no one, nor need their truthfulness be questioned.
He possessed an unusual psychical nature, delicately
organized, capable of experiences of a novel sort,
but such as are to-day very familiar to the student of
psychical phenomena. The marvel is that with such
a mental organization he was so sane and practical,
and so steadily kept his balance throughout a life
which furnished numerous chances for shipwreck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very noticeable&mdash;rather more so in the complete
Journal than in this Autobiography&mdash;that
"judgments" came upon almost everybody who was
a malicious opposer of him or his work. "God cut
him off soon after," is a not infrequent phrase. It is
manifestly impossible to investigate these cases now,
and to verify the facts, but the well-tested honesty
of the early Friends leaves little ground for doubting
that the facts were substantially as they are reported.
Fox's own inference that all these persons
had misfortune as a direct "judgment" for having
harmed him and hindered his cause will naturally
seem to us a too hasty conclusion. It is not at all
strange that in this eventful period many persons
who had dealings with him should have suffered swift
changes of fortune, and of course he failed to note
how many there were who did <em>not</em> receive judgment
in this direct manner. One regrets, of course, that
this kindly spiritual man should have come so near
enjoying what seemed to him a divine vengeance
upon his enemies, but we must remember that he believed
in his soul that his work was God's work, and
hence to frustrate it was serious business.</p>

<p>He founded a Society, as he called it, which he evidently
hoped, and probably believed, would sometime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
become universal.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> The organization in every
aspect recognized the fundamentally spiritual nature
of man. Every individual was to be a vital, organic
part of the whole; free, but possessed of a freedom
which had always to be exercised with a view to the
interests and edification of the whole. It was modelled
exactly on the conception of Paul's universal
Church of many members, made a <em>unity</em> not from
without, but by the living presence of the One Spirit.
All this work of organization was effected while Fox
himself was in the saddle, carrying his message to
town after town, interrupted by long absences in jail
and dungeon, and steadily opposed by the fanatical
antinomian elements which had flocked to his standard.
It is not the least mark of his genius that in
the face of an almost unparalleled persecution he left
his fifty thousand followers in Great Britain and Ireland
formed into a working and growing body, with
equally well-organized meetings in Holland, New
England, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia
and the Carolinas. His personality and his message
had won men from every station of life, and if
the rank and file were from the humbler walks, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
were also men and women of scholarship and fame.
Robert Barclay, from the schools of Paris, gave the
new faith its permanent expression in his Apology.
William Penn worked its principles out in a holy
experiment in a Christian Commonwealth, and Isaac
Penington, in his brief essays, set forth in rich and
varied phrase the mystical truth which was at the
heart of the doctrine.</p>

<p>This is the place for exposition, not for criticism.
It requires no searchlight to reveal in this man the
limitations and imperfections which his age and his
own personal peculiarities fixed upon him. He saw
in part and he prophesied in part. But, like his
great contemporary, Cromwell, he had a brave sincerity,
a soul absolutely loyal to the highest he saw.
The testimony of the Scarborough jailer is as true
as it is unstudied&mdash;"as stiff as a tree and as pure as a
bell." It is fitting that this study of him should close
with the words of the man who knew him best&mdash;William
Penn: "I write my knowledge and not report,
and my witness is true, having been with him for
weeks and months together on diverse occasions, and
those of the nearest and most exercising nature, by
sea and land, in this country and in foreign countries;
and I can say I never saw him out of his place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
or not a match for every service or occasion. For in
all things he acquitted himself like a man, yea, a
strong man, a new and heavenly-minded man; a divine
and a naturalist, and all of God Almighty's
making."<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_PENN_CONCERNING" id="THE_TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_PENN_CONCERNING">THE TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM PENN CONCERNING
THAT FAITHFUL SERVANT</a></h2>

<h2>GEORGE FOX.</h2>


<p>The blessed instrument of and in this day of God,
and of whom I am now about to write, was George
Fox, distinguished from another of that name, by that
other's addition of younger to his name in all his
writings; not that he was so in years, but that he
was so in the truth; but he was also a worthy man,
witness and servant of God in his time.</p>

<p>But this George Fox was born in Leicestershire,
about the year 1624. He descended of honest and
sufficient parents, who endeavoured to bring him up,
as they did the rest of their children, in the way and
worship of the nation; especially his mother, who
was a woman accomplished above most of her degree
in the place where she lived. But from a child he
appeared of another frame of mind than the rest of
his brethren; being more religious, inward, still, solid,
and observing, beyond his years, as the answers he
would give, and the questions he would put upon
occasion manifested, to the astonishment of those
that heard him, especially in divine things.</p>

<p>His mother taking notice of his singular temper,
and the gravity, wisdom, and piety that very early
shone through him, refusing childish and vain sports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and company when very young, she was tender and
indulgent over him, so that from her he met with little
difficulty. As to his employment, he was brought
up in country business; and as he took most delight in
sheep, so he was very skilful in them; an employment
that very well suited his mind in several respects,
both for its innocency and solitude; and was
a just figure of his after ministry and service.</p>

<p>I shall not break in upon his own account, which
is by much the best that can be given; and therefore
desire, what I can, to avoid saying anything of what
is said already, as to the particular passages of his
coming forth; but, in general, when he was somewhat
above twenty, he left his friends, and visited the most
retired and religious people, and some there were at
that time in this nation, especially in those parts,
who waited for the consolation of Israel night and
day, as Zacharias, Anna, and good old Simeon did of
old time. To these he was sent, and these he sought
out in the neighboring countries, and among them
he sojourned till his more ample ministry came upon
him.</p>

<p>At this time he taught and was an example of
silence, endeavouring to bring people from self-performances,
testifying and turning to the light of
Christ within them, and encouraging them to wait
in patience to feel the power of it to stir in their
hearts, that their knowledge and worship of God
might stand in the power of an endless life, which was
to be found in the light, as it was obeyed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
manifestation of it in man. "For in the Word was
life, and that life was the light of men." Life in the
Word, light in men, and life too, as the light is
obeyed; the children of the light living by the life of
the Word, by which the Word begets them again to
God, which is the regeneration and new birth, without
which there is no coming unto the kingdom of
God; and which, whoever comes to, is greater than
John, that is, than John's ministry, which was not
that of the kingdom, but the consummation of the
legal, and opening of the gospel-dispensation. Accordingly,
several meetings were gathered in those
parts; and thus his time was employed for some
years.</p>

<p>In 1652, he being in his usual retirement to the
Lord upon a very high mountain, in some of the
hither parts of Yorkshire, as I take it, his mind exercised
towards the Lord, he had a vision of the great
work of God in the earth, and of the way that he was
to go forth to begin it. He saw people as thick as
motes in the sun, that should in time be brought
home to the Lord, that there might be but one Shepherd
and one sheepfold in all the earth. There his
eye was directed northward, beholding a great people
that should receive him and his message in those
parts. Upon this mountain he was moved of the
Lord to sound out his great and notable day, as if he
had been in a great auditory, and from thence went
north, as the Lord had shewn him: and in every place
where he came, if not before he came to it, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
his particular exercise and service shewn to him, so
that the Lord was his leader indeed; for it was not
in vain that he travelled, God in most places sealing
his commission with the convincement of some of all
sorts, as well publicans as sober professors of religion.
Some of the first and most eminent of them,
which are at rest, were Richard Farnsworth, James
Nayler, William Dewsberry, Francis Howgil, Edward
Burrough, John Camm, John Audland, Richard
Hubberthorn, T. Taylor, John Aldam, T. Holmes,
Alexander Parker, William Simpson, William Caton,
John Stubbs, Robert Widders, John Burnyeat,
Robert Lodge, Thomas Salthouse, and many more
worthies, that cannot be well here named, together
with divers yet living of the first and great convincement,
who after the knowledge of God's purging
judgments in themselves, and some time of waiting in
silence upon him, to feel and receive power from on
high to speak in his name (which none else rightly
can, though they may use the same words), felt the
divine motions, and were frequently drawn forth,
especially to visit the publick assemblies, to reprove,
inform and exhort them, sometimes in markets, fairs,
streets, and by the highway side, calling people to
repentance, and to turn to the Lord with their hearts
as well as their mouths; directing them to the light of
Christ within them, to see and examine and consider
their ways by, and to eschew the evil and do the good
and acceptable will of God. And they suffered great
hardships for this their love and good-will, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
often stocked, stoned, beaten, whipped and imprisoned,
though honest men and of good report where
they lived, that had left wives and children, and
houses and lands, to visit them with a living call to repentance.
And though the priests generally set themselves
to oppose them, and write against them, and
insinuated most false and scandalous stories to defame
them, stirring up the magistrates to suppress
them, especially in those northern parts, yet God
was pleased so to fill them with his living power, and
give them such an open door of utterance in his service,
that there was a mighty convincement over
those parts.</p>

<p>And through the tender and singular indulgence of
Judge Bradshaw and Judge Fell, in the infancy of
things, the priests were never able to gain the point
they laboured for, which was to have proceeded to
blood, and if possible, Herod-like, by a cruel exercise
of the civil power, to have cut them off and rooted
them out of the country. Especially Judge Fell, who
was not only a check to their rage in the course of
legal proceedings, but otherwise upon occasion, and
finally countenanced this people; for his wife receiving
the truth with the first, it had that influence upon
his spirit, being a just and wise man, and seeing in his
own wife and family a full confutation of all the
popular clamours against the way of truth, that he
covered them what he could, and freely opened his
doors, and gave up his house to his wife and her
friends, not valuing the reproach of ignorant or evil-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
people, which I here mention to his and her
honour, and which will be I believe an honour and a
blessing to such of their name and family as shall be
found in that tenderness, humility, love and zeal for
the truth and people of the Lord.</p>

<p>That house was for some years at first, till the truth
had opened its way in the southern parts of this
island, an eminent receptacle of this people. Others
of good note and substance in those northern countries
had also opened their houses with their hearts
to the many publishers, that in a short time the Lord
had raised to declare his salvation to the people, and
where meetings of the Lord's messengers were frequently
held, to communicate their services and exercises,
and comfort and edify one another in their
blessed ministry.</p>

<p>But lest this may be thought a digression, having
touched upon this before, I return to this excellent
man: and for his personal qualities, both natural,
moral, and divine, as they appeared in his converse
with his brethren and in the church of God, take as
follows.</p>

<p>I. He was a man that God endowed with a clear
and wonderful depth, a discerner of others' spirits,
and very much a master of his own. And though the
side of his understanding which lay next to the world,
and especially the expression of it, might sound uncouth
and unfashionable to nice ears, his matter was
nevertheless very profound, and would not only bear
to be often considered, but the more it was so, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
more weighty and instructing it appeared. And as
abruptly and brokenly as sometimes his sentences
would fall from him about divine things, it is well
known they were often as texts to many fairer declarations.
And indeed it shewed beyond all contradiction
that God sent him, that no arts or parts had any
share in the matter or manner of his ministry, and
that so many great, excellent, and necessary truths
as he came forth to preach to mankind, had therefore
nothing of man's wit or wisdom to recommend them.
So that as to man he was an original, being no man's
copy. And his ministry and writings shew they are
from one that was not taught of man, nor had learned
what he said by study. Nor were they notional or
speculative, but sensible and practical truths, tending
to conversion and regeneration, and the setting up
the kingdom of God in the hearts of men, and the
way of it was his work. So that I have many times
been overcome in myself, and been made to say with
my Lord and Master upon the like occasion, "I thank
thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou
hast hid these things from the wise and prudent of
this world, and revealed them to babes"; for many
times hath my soul bowed in an humble thankfulness
to the Lord, that he did not choose any of the wise
and learned of this world to be the first messenger
in our age of his blessed truth to men; but that
he took one that was not of high degree, or elegant
speech, or learned after the way of this world, that
his message and work He sent him to do might come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with less suspicion or jealousy of human wisdom and
interest, and with more force and clearness upon the
consciences of those that sincerely sought the way of
truth in the love of it. I say, beholding with the eye
of my mind, which the God of heaven had opened in
me, the marks of God's finger and hand visibly in this
testimony from the clearness of the principle, the
power and efficacy of it in the exemplary sobriety,
plainness, zeal, steadiness, humility, gravity, punctuality,
charity, and circumspect care in the government
of church affairs, which shined in his and their
life and testimony that God employed in this work,
it greatly confirmed me that it was of God, and engaged
my soul in a deep love, fear, reverence, and
thankfulness for his love and mercy therein to mankind;
in which mind I remain, and shall, I hope, to
the end of my days.</p>

<p>II. In his testimony or ministry he much laboured
to open truth to the people's understandings, and to
bottom them upon the principle and principal, Christ
Jesus, the light of the world, that by bringing them
to something that was of God in themselves, they
might the better know and judge of him and themselves.</p>

<p>He had an extraordinary gift in opening the
Scriptures. He would go to the marrow of things,
and shew the mind, harmony, and fulfilling of them
with much plainness, and to great comfort and edification.</p>

<p>The mystery of the first and second Adam, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
fall and restoration, of the law and gospel, of
shadows and substance, of the servant and son's state,
and the fulfilling of the Scriptures in Christ, and by
Christ the true light, in all that are His, through the
obedience of faith, were much of the substance and
drift of his testimonies. In all which he was witnessed
to be of God, being sensibly felt to speak that
which he had received of Christ, and was his own
experience in that which never errs nor fails.</p>

<p>But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardness
and weight of his spirit, the reverence and solemnity
of his address and behaviour, and the fewness
and fullness of his words, have often struck even
strangers with admiration, as they used to reach
others with consolation. The most awful, living,
reverent frame I ever felt or beheld, I must say, was
his in prayer. And truly it was a testimony he knew,
and lived nearer to the Lord than other men; for they
that know him most will see most reason to approach
him with reverence and fear.</p>

<p>He was of an innocent life, no busy-body, nor self-seeker,
neither touchy nor critical: what fell from
him was very inoffensive, if not very edifying. So
meek, contented, modest, easy, steady, tender, it was
a pleasure to be in his company. He exercised no
authority but over evil, and that everywhere and in
all; but with love, compassion, and long-suffering. A
most merciful man, as ready to forgive as unapt to
take or give offence. Thousands can truly say, he
was of an excellent spirit and savour among them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and because thereof the most excellent spirits loved
him with an unfeigned and unfading love.</p>

<p>He was an incessant labourer; for in his younger
time, before his many great and deep sufferings and
travels had enfeebled his body for itinerant services,
he laboured much in the word and doctrine and discipline
in England, Scotland, and Ireland, turning
many to God, and confirming those that were convinced
of the truth, and settling good order as to
church affairs among them. And towards the conclusion
of his travelling services, between the years
seventy-one and seventy-seven, he visited the
churches of Christ in the plantations in America, and
in the United Provinces, and Germany, as his following
Journal relates, to the convincement and consolation
of many. After that time he chiefly resided in
and about the city of London, and besides the services
of his ministry, which were frequent, he wrote much
both to them that are within and those that are without
the communion. But the care he took of the
affairs of the church in general was very great.</p>

<p>He was often where the records of the affairs of
the church are kept, and the letters from the many
meetings of God's people over all the world, where
settled, come upon occasions; which letters he had
read to him, and communicated them to the meeting
that is weekly held there for such services; he would
be sure to stir them up to discharge them, especially
in suffering cases: showing great sympathy and compassion
upon all such occasions, carefully looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into the respective cases, and endeavouring speedy
relief according to the nature of them; so that the
churches and any of the suffering members thereof
were sure not to be forgotten or delayed in their
desires if he were there.</p>

<p>As he was unwearied, so he was undaunted in his
services for God and his people; he was no more to
be moved to fear than to wrath. His behaviour at
Derby, Litchfield, Appleby, before Oliver Cromwell
at Launceston, Scarborough, Worcester, and Westminster-hall,
with many other places and exercises,
did abundantly evidence it to his enemies as well as
his friends.</p>

<p>But as in the primitive times some rose up against
the blessed apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, even
from among those that they had turned to the hope
of the gospel, and who became their greatest trouble,
so this man of God had his share of suffering from
some that were convinced by him, who through prejudice
or mistake ran against him as one that sought
dominion over conscience; because he pressed, by his
presence or epistles, a ready and zealous compliance
with such good and wholesome things as tended to an
orderly conversation about the affairs of the church,
and in their walking before men. That which contributed
much to this ill work, was in some a begrudging
of this meek man the love and esteem he had and
deserved in the hearts of the people, and weakness in
others that were taken with their groundless suggestions
of imposition and blind obedience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>They would have had every man independent, that
as he had the principle in himself, he should only
stand and fall to that and nobody else; not considering
that the principle is one in all, and though the
measure of light or grace might differ, yet the nature
of it was the same, and being so they struck at the
spiritual unity, which a people guided by the same
principle are naturally led into: so that what is evil
to one is so to all, and what is virtuous, honest, and of
good report to one, is so to all, from the sense and
savour of the one universal principle which is common
to all, and (which the disaffected profess to be)
the root of all true Christian fellowship, and that
spirit into which the people of God drink, and come
to be spiritually minded, and of one heart and one
soul.</p>

<p>Some weakly mistook good order in the government
of church-affairs for discipline in worship, and
that it was so pressed or recommended by him and
other brethren; and they were ready to reflect the
same things that dissenters had very reasonably objected
upon the national churches, that have coercively
pressed conformity to their respective creeds
and worships: whereas these things related wholly to
conversation, and the outward and (as I may say)
civil part of the church, that men should walk up to
the principles of their belief, and not be wanting in
care and charity. But though some have stumbled
and fallen through mistakes and an unreasonable
obstinacy, even to a prejudice, yet blessed be God, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
generality have returned to their first love, and seen
the work of the enemy, that loses no opportunity or
advantage by which he may check or hinder the work
of God, and disquiet the peace of His church, and
chill the love of His people to the truth, and one to
another; and there is hope of divers that are yet at
a distance.</p>

<p>In all these occasions, though there was no person
the discontented struck so sharply at as this good
man, he bore all their weakness and prejudice, and
returned not reflection for reflection; but forgave
them their weak and bitter speeches, praying for
them that they might have a sense of their hurt, and
see the subtlety of the enemy to rend and divide, and
return into their first love that thought no ill.</p>

<p>And truly, I must say, that though God had visibly
cloathed him with a divine preference and authority,
and indeed his very presence expressed a religious
majesty, yet he never abused it, but held his place
in the church of God with great meekness, and a most
engaging humility and moderation. For upon all
occasions, like his blessed Master, he was a servant to
all, holding and exercising his eldership in the invisible
power that had gathered them, with reverence to
the head and care over the body, and was received
only in that spirit and power of Christ, as the first
and chief elder in this age; who as he was therefore
worthy of double honour, so for the same reason it
was given by the faithful of this day; because his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
authority was inward and not outward, and that he
got it and kept it by the love of God and power of
an endless life. I write my knowledge and not report,
and my witness is true, having been with him
for weeks and months together on divers occasions,
and those of the nearest and most exercising nature,
and that by night and by day, by sea and by land, in
this and in foreign countries: and I can say I never
saw him out of his place, or not a match for every
service or occasion.</p>

<p>For in all things he acquitted himself like a man,
yea a strong man, a new and heavenly-minded man.
A divine, and a naturalist, and all of God Almighty's
making. I have been surprised at his questions and
answers in natural things, that whilst he was ignorant
of useless and sophistical science, he had in him
the foundation of useful and commendable knowledge,
and cherished it everywhere. Civil beyond all
forms of breeding in his behaviour; very temperate,
eating little and sleeping less, though a bulky person.</p>

<p>Thus he lived and sojourned among us, and as he
lived so he died, feeling the same eternal power that
had raised and preserved him in his last moments.
So full of assurance was he that he triumphed over
death; and so even to the last, as if death were hardly
worth notice or a mention: recommending to some
with him the dispatch and dispersion of an epistle,
just before written to the churches of Christ,
throughout the world, and his own books; but above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
all, friends, and of all friends those in Ireland and
America, twice over: saying, Mind poor friends in
Ireland and America.</p>

<p>And to some that came in and inquired how he
found himself, he answered, "Never heed, the
Lord's power is over all weakness and death, the Seed
reigns, blessed be the Lord": which was about four
or five hours before his departure out of this world.
He was at the great meeting near Lombard Street on
the first day of the week, and it was the third following
about ten at night when he left us, being at the
house of H. Goldney in the same court. In a good
old age he went, after having lived to see his children's
children to several generations in the truth.
He had the comfort of a short illness, and the blessing
of a clear sense to the last; and we may truly say
with a man of God of old, that "being dead, he yet
speaketh"; and though absent in body, he is present
in Spirit; neither time nor place being able to interrupt
the communion of saints, or dissolve the fellowship
of the spirits of the just. His works praise him,
because they are to the praise of Him that worked
by him; for which his memorial is and shall be
blessed. I have done, as to this part of my preface,
when I have left this short epitaph to his name:
"Many sons have done virtuously in this day, but,
dear George, thou excellest them all."</p>

<h3>1624-1648.</h3>


<p>That all may know the dealings of the Lord with
me, and the various exercises, trials, and troubles
through which He led me, in order to prepare and fit
me for the work unto which He had appointed me,
and may thereby be drawn to admire and glorify His
infinite wisdom and goodness, I think fit (before I
proceed to set forth my public travels in the service
of Truth) briefly to mention how it was with me in
my youth, and how the work of the Lord was begun,
and gradually carried on in me, even from my childhood.</p>

<p>I was born in the month called July, 1624, at
Drayton-in-the-Clay,<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in Leicestershire. My father's
name was Christopher Fox; he was by profession a
weaver, an honest man; and there was a Seed of God
in him. The neighbours called him Righteous Christer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
My mother was an upright woman; her maiden
name was Mary Lago, of the family of the Lagos, and
of the stock of the martyrs.<a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In my very young years I had a gravity and
stayedness of mind and spirit not usual in children;
insomuch that when I saw old men behave lightly
and wantonly towards each other, I had a dislike
thereof raised in my heart, and said within myself,
"If ever I come to be a man, surely I shall not do
so, nor be so wanton."</p>

<p>When I came to eleven years of age I knew pureness
and righteousness; for while a child I was taught
how to walk to be kept pure. The Lord taught me to
be faithful in all things, and to act faithfully two
ways, viz., inwardly, to God, and outwardly, to man;
and to keep to Yea and Nay in all things. For the
Lord showed me that, though the people of the world
have mouths full of deceit, and changeable words,
yet I was to keep to Yea and Nay in all things; and
that my words should be few and savoury, seasoned
with grace; and that I might not eat and drink to
make myself wanton, but for health, using the creatures<a name="FNanchor_3_9" id="FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_9" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
in their service, as servants in their places,
to the glory of Him that created them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>As I grew up, my relations thought to have made
me a priest,<a name="FNanchor_4_10" id="FNanchor_4_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_10" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but others persuaded to the contrary.
Whereupon I was put to a man who was a shoemaker<a name="FNanchor_5_11" id="FNanchor_5_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_11" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
by trade, and dealt in wool. He also used
grazing, and sold cattle; and a great deal went
through my hands. While I was with him he was
blessed, but after I left him he broke and came to
nothing.</p>

<p>I never wronged man or woman in all that time;
for the Lord's power was with me and over me, to
preserve me. While I was in that service I used in
my dealings the word Verily, and it was a common
saying among those that knew me, "If George says
verily, there is no altering him." When boys and
rude persons would laugh at me, I let them alone and
went my way; but people had generally a love to me
for my innocency and honesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>When I came towards nineteen years of age, being
upon business at a fair, one of my cousins, whose
name was Bradford, having another professor<a name="FNanchor_6_12" id="FNanchor_6_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_12" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> with
him, came and asked me to drink part of a jug of
beer with them. I, being thirsty, went in with them
for I loved any who had a sense of good, or that
sought after the Lord.</p>

<p>When we had drunk a glass apiece, they began to
drink healths, and called for more drink, agreeing together
that he that would not drink should pay all.
I was grieved that any who made profession of religion
should offer to do so. They grieved me very
much, having never had such a thing put to me before
by any sort of people. Wherefore I rose up,
and, putting my hand in my pocket, took out a groat,
and laid it upon the table before them, saying, "If
it be so, I will leave you."</p>

<p>So I went away; and when I had done my business
returned home; but did not go to bed that night, nor
could I sleep, but sometimes walked up and down,
and sometimes prayed and cried to the Lord, who said
unto me: "Thou seest how young people go together
into vanity, and old people into the earth; thou must
forsake all, young and old, keep out of all, and be as
a stranger unto all."</p>

<p>Then, at the command of God, the ninth of the Seventh
month, 1643, I left my relations, and broke off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
all familiarity or fellowship with young or old. I
passed to Lutterworth, where I stayed some time.
From thence I went to Northampton, where also I
made some stay; then passed to Newport-Pagnel,
whence, after I had stayed awhile, I went to Barnet,
in the Fourth month, called June,<a name="FNanchor_7_13" id="FNanchor_7_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_13" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in the year 1644.</p>

<p>As I thus traveled through the country, professors
took notice of me, and sought to be acquainted with
me; but I was afraid of them, for I was sensible they
did not possess what they professed.</p>

<p>During the time I was at Barnet a strong temptation
to despair came upon me. I then saw how
Christ was tempted, and mighty troubles I was in.
Sometimes I kept myself retired to my chamber, and
often walked solitary in the Chase to wait upon the
Lord. I wondered why these things should come to
me. I looked upon myself, and said, "Was I ever so
before?" Then I thought, because I had forsaken
my relations I had done amiss against them.</p>

<p>So I was brought to call to mind all my time that
I had spent, and to consider whether I had wronged
any; but temptations grew more and more, and I was
tempted almost to despair; and when Satan could not
effect his design upon me that way, he laid snares
and baits to draw me to commit some sin, whereof he
might take advantage to bring me to despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>I was about twenty years of age when these exercises
came upon me; and some years I continued in
that condition, in great trouble; and fain I would
have put it from me. I went to many a priest to
look for comfort, but found no comfort from them.</p>

<p>From Barnet I went to London, where I took a
lodging, and was under great misery and trouble
there; for I looked upon the great professors of the
city of London, and saw all was dark and under the
chain of darkness. I had an uncle there, one Pickering,
a Baptist; the Baptists were tender<a name="FNanchor_8_14" id="FNanchor_8_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_14" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> then; yet
I could not impart my mind to him, nor join with
them; for I saw all, young and old, where they were.
Some tender people would have had me stay, but
I was fearful, and returned homeward into Leicestershire,
having a regard upon my mind to my parents
and relations, lest I should grieve them, for I understood
they were troubled at my absence.</p>

<p>Being returned<a name="FNanchor_9_15" id="FNanchor_9_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_15" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> into Leicestershire, my relations
would have had me married; but I told them I was but
a lad, and must get wisdom. Others would have had
me join the auxiliary band among the soldiery,<a name="FNanchor_G_16" id="FNanchor_G_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_16" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
I refused, and was grieved that they offered such
things to me, being a tender youth. Then I went
to Coventry, where I took a chamber for awhile at
a professor's house, till people began to be acquainted
with me, for there were many tender people in that
town. After some time I went into my own country
again, and continued about a year, in great sorrow
and trouble, and walked many nights by myself.</p>

<p>Then the priest of Drayton, the town of my birth,
whose name was Nathaniel Stephens, came often to
me, and I went often to him; and another priest
sometimes came with him; and they would give place
to me, to hear me; and I would ask them questions,
and reason with them. This priest, Stephens, asked
me why Christ cried out upon the cross, "My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" and why He
said, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
yet not my will, but thine, be done"? I told him
that at that time the sins of all mankind were upon
Him, and their iniquities and transgressions, with
which He was wounded; which He was to bear, and
to be an offering for, as He was man; but died not,
as He was God; so, in that He died for all men, tasting
death for every man, He was an offering for the
sins of the whole world.</p>

<p>This I spoke, being at that time in a measure sensible
of Christ's sufferings. The priest said it was a
very good, full answer, and such a one as he had not
heard. At that time he would applaud and speak
highly of me to others; and what I said in discourse
to him on week-days, he would preach of on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
First-days,<a name="FNanchor_10_17" id="FNanchor_10_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_17" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which gave me a dislike to him. This priest
afterwards became my great persecutor.</p>

<p>After this I went to another ancient priest<a name="FNanchor_H_18" id="FNanchor_H_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_18" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> at
Mancetter, in Warwickshire, and reasoned with him
about the ground of despair and temptations. But
he was ignorant of my condition; he bade me take tobacco
and sing psalms. Tobacco was a thing I did
not love, and psalms I was not in a state to sing; I
could not sing. He bade me come again, and he
would tell me many things; but when I came he was
angry and pettish, for my former words had displeased
him. He told my troubles, sorrows, and
griefs to his servants, so that it got out among the
milk-lasses. It grieved me that I should have
opened my mind to such a one. I saw they were all
miserable comforters, and this increased my troubles
upon me. I heard of a priest living about Tamworth,
who was accounted an experienced man. I went
seven miles to him, but found him like an empty,
hollow cask.</p>

<p>I heard also of one called Dr. Cradock, of Coventry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and went to him. I asked him the ground of
temptations and despair, and how troubles came to
be wrought in man? He asked me, "Who were
Christ's father and mother?" I told him, Mary was
His mother, and that He was supposed to be the Son
of Joseph, but He was the Son of God.</p>

<p>Now, as we were walking together in his garden,
the alley being narrow, I chanced, in turning, to set
my foot on the side of a bed, at which the man was in
a rage, as if his house had been on fire. Thus all our
discourse was lost, and I went away in sorrow, worse
than I was when I came. I thought them miserable
comforters, and saw they were all as nothing to me,
for they could not reach my condition.</p>

<p>After this I went to another, one Macham,<a name="FNanchor_I_19" id="FNanchor_I_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_19" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> a
priest in high account. He would needs give me
some physic, and I was to have been let blood; but
they could not get one drop of blood from me, either
in arms or head (though they endeavoured to do so),
my body being, as it were, dried up with sorrows,
grief and troubles, which were so great upon me that
I could have wished I had never been born, or that I
had been born blind, that I might never have seen
wickedness or vanity; and deaf, that I might never
have heard vain and wicked words, or the Lord's
name blasphemed.</p>

<p>When the time called Christmas came, while others
were feasting and sporting themselves I looked
out poor widows from house to house, and gave them
some money. When I was invited to marriages (as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
I sometimes was), I went to none at all; but the next
day, or soon after, I would go and visit them, and if
they were poor I gave them some money; for I had
wherewith both to keep myself from being chargeable
to others and to administer something to the necessities
of those who were in need.<a name="FNanchor_11_20" id="FNanchor_11_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_20" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>About the beginning of the year 1646, as I was
going to Coventry, and approaching towards the gate,
a consideration arose in me, how it was said that
"All Christians are believers, both Protestants
and Papists"; and the Lord opened<a name="FNanchor_12_21" id="FNanchor_12_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_21" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to me that
if all were believers, then they were all born of God,
and passed from death to life; and that none were
true believers but such; and, though others said they
were believers, yet they were not. At another time,
as I was walking in a field on a First-day morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the Lord opened unto me that being bred at Oxford
or Cambridge was not enough to fit and qualify men
to be ministers of Christ; and I wondered at it, because
it was the common belief of people. But I saw
it clearly as the Lord opened it unto me, and was
satisfied, and admired the goodness of the Lord, who
had opened this thing unto me that morning. This
struck at priest Stephens's ministry, namely, that "to
be bred at Oxford or Cambridge was not enough to
make a man fit to be a minister of Christ." So that
which opened in me I saw struck at the priest's ministry.</p>

<p>But my relations were much troubled that
I would not go with them to hear the priest; for I
would go into the orchard or the fields, with my Bible,
by myself. I asked them, "Did not the Apostle say
to believers that they needed no man to teach them,
but as the anointing teacheth them?" Though they
knew this was Scripture, and that it was true, yet
they were grieved because I could not be subject in
this matter, to go to hear the priest with them. I saw
that to be a true believer was another thing than they
looked upon it to be; and I saw that being bred at
Oxford or Cambridge did not qualify or fit a man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
be a minister of Christ; what then should I follow
such for? So neither them, nor any of the dissenting
people, could I join with; but was as a stranger
to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>At another time it was opened in me that
God, who made the world, did not dwell in temples
made with hands. This at first seemed a strange
word, because both priests and people used to call
their temples, or churches, dreadful places, holy
ground, and the temples of God. But the Lord
showed me clearly that He did not dwell in these
temples which men had commanded and set up,
but in people's hearts; for both Stephen and
the apostle Paul bore testimony that He did not
dwell in temples made with hands, not even in that
which He had once commanded to be built, since He
put an end to it; but that His people were His temple,
and He dwelt in them.</p>

<p>This opened in me as I walked in the fields to
my relations' house. When I came there they
told me that Nathaniel Stephens, the priest, had
been there, and told them he was afraid of me,
for going after new lights. I smiled in myself,
knowing what the Lord had opened in me concerning
him and his brethren; but I told not my
relations, who, though they saw beyond the priests,
yet went to hear them, and were grieved because
I would not go also. But I brought them Scriptures,<a name="FNanchor_J_22" id="FNanchor_J_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_22" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
and told them there was an anointing within
man to teach him, and that the Lord would teach
His people Himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>I had also great openings concerning the things
written in the Revelations; and when I spoke of
them the priests and professors would say that
was a sealed book, and would have kept me out
of it. But I told them Christ could open the
seals, and that they were the nearest things to
us; for the epistles were written to the saints that
lived in former ages, but the Revelations were written
of things to come.</p>

<p>After this I met with a sort of people that held
women have no souls, (adding in a light manner), No
more than a goose.<a name="FNanchor_13_23" id="FNanchor_13_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_23" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But I reproved them, and told
them that was not right; for Mary said, "My soul
doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in
God my Saviour."</p>

<p>Removing to another place, I came among a people
that relied much on dreams. I told them, except
they could distinguish between dream and dream,
they would confound all together; for there were
three sorts of dreams; multitude of business sometimes
caused dreams, and there were whisperings of
Satan in man in the night season; and there were
speakings of God to man in dreams. But these people
came out of these things, and at last became
Friends.<a name="FNanchor_14_24" id="FNanchor_14_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_24" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Now, though I had great openings, yet great trouble
and temptation came many times upon me; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that when it was day I wished for night, and when it
was night I wished for day; and by reason of the
openings I had in my troubles, I could say as David
said, "Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto
night showeth knowledge." When I had openings
they answered one another and answered the Scriptures;
for I had great openings of the Scriptures:
and when I was in troubles, one trouble also answered
to another.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the year 1647 I was moved
of the Lord to go into Derbyshire, where I met with
some friendly people, and had many discourses with
them. Then, passing into the Peak country,<a name="FNanchor_15_25" id="FNanchor_15_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_25" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I met
with more friendly people, and with some in empty
high notions.<a name="FNanchor_16_26" id="FNanchor_16_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_26" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Travelling through some parts of
Leicestershire, and into Nottinghamshire, I met with
a tender people, and a very tender woman, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
name was Elizabeth Hooton.<a name="FNanchor_17_27" id="FNanchor_17_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_27" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> With these I had
some meetings and discourses; but my troubles continued,
and I was often under great temptations.</p>

<p>I fasted much, walked abroad in solitary places
many days, and often took my Bible, and sat in hollow
trees and lonesome places till night came on; and
frequently in the night walked mournfully about by
myself; for I was a man of sorrows in the time of the
first workings of the Lord in me.</p>

<p>During all this time I was never joined in profession
of religion with any, but gave up myself to the
Lord, having forsaken all evil company, taken leave
of father and mother, and all other relations, and
travelled up and down as a stranger in the earth,
which way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a
chamber to myself in the town where I came, and
tarrying, sometimes more, sometimes less, in a place.
For I durst not stay long in a place, being afraid both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of professor and profane, lest, being a tender young
man, I should be hurt by conversing much with
either. For this reason I kept much as a stranger,
seeking heavenly wisdom and getting knowledge
from the Lord, and was brought off from outward
things to rely on the Lord alone.</p>

<p>Though my exercises and troubles were very
great, yet were they not so continual but that
I had some intermissions, and I was sometimes
brought into such an heavenly joy that I thought I
had been in Abraham's bosom.</p>

<p>As I cannot declare the misery I was in, it was so
great and heavy upon me, so neither can I set forth
the mercies of God unto me in all my misery. O the
everlasting love of God to my soul, when I was in
great distress! When my troubles and torments were
great, then was His love exceeding great. Thou,
Lord, makest a fruitful field a barren wilderness, and
a barren wilderness a fruitful field! Thou bringest
down and settest up! Thou killest and makest alive!
all honour and glory be to thee, O Lord of Glory!
The knowledge of Thee in the Spirit is life; but that
knowledge which is fleshly works death.<a name="FNanchor_18_28" id="FNanchor_18_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_28" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>While there is this knowledge in the flesh, deceit
and self will conform to anything, and will say Yes,
Yes, to that it doth not know. The knowledge which
the world hath of what the prophets and apostles
spake, is a fleshly knowledge; and the apostates from
the life in which the prophets and apostles were have
got their words, the Holy Scriptures, in a form, but
not in the life nor spirit that gave them forth. So
they all lie in confusion; and are making provision
for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, but not to fulfil
the law and command of Christ in His power and
Spirit. For that they say they cannot do; but to
fulfil the lusts of the flesh, that they can do with delight.</p>

<p>Now, after I had received that opening from the
Lord, that to be bred at Oxford or Cambridge was
not sufficient to fit a man to be a minister of Christ,
I regarded the priests less, and looked more after
the Dissenting people.<a name="FNanchor_K_29" id="FNanchor_K_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_29" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> Among them I saw there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was some tenderness; and many of them came afterwards
to be convinced, for they had some openings.</p>

<p>But as I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate
preachers also, and those esteemed the most experienced
people; for I saw there was none among
them all that could speak to my condition. When all
my hopes in them and in all men were gone, so that I
had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could I tell
what to do, then, oh, then, I heard a voice which said,
"There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to
thy condition";<a name="FNanchor_19_30" id="FNanchor_19_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_30" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and when I heard it, my heart did
leap for joy.</p>

<p>Then the Lord let me see why there was none
upon the earth that could speak to my condition,
namely, that I might give Him all the glory.
For all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief,
as I had been; that Jesus Christ might have the
pre-eminence, who enlightens, and gives grace, and
faith, and power. Thus when God doth work, who
shall hinder it? and <em>this I knew experimentally</em>.</p>

<p>My desire after the Lord grew stronger, and zeal
in the pure knowledge of God, and of Christ alone,
without the help of any man, book, or writing. For
though I read the Scriptures that spoke of Christ and
of God, yet I knew Him not, but by revelation, as He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
who hath the key did open, and as the Father of Life
drew me to His Son by His Spirit. Then the Lord
gently led me along, and let me see His love, which
was endless and eternal, surpassing all the knowledge
that men have in the natural state, or can obtain
from history or books; and that love let me see myself,
as I was without Him.</p>

<p>I was afraid of all company, for I saw them
perfectly where they were, through the love of
God, which let me see myself. I had not fellowship
with any people, priests or professors,
or any sort of separated people, but with Christ,
who hath the key, and opened the door of Light
and Life unto me. I was afraid of all carnal
talk and talkers, for I could see nothing but corruptions,
and the life lay under the burthen of corruptions.</p>

<p>When I myself was in the deep, shut up under
all, I could not believe that I should ever overcome;
my troubles, my sorrows, and my temptations
were so great that I thought many times I should
have despaired, I was so tempted. But when Christ
opened to me how He was tempted by the same devil,
and overcame him and bruised his head, and that
through Him and His power, light, grace, and Spirit,
I should overcome also, I had confidence in Him; so
He it was that opened to me when I was shut up and
had no hope nor faith. Christ, who had enlightened
me, gave me His light to believe in; He gave me
hope, which He Himself revealed in me, and He gave
me His Spirit and grace, which I found sufficient in
the deeps and in weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, in the deepest miseries, and in the greatest
sorrows and temptations, that many times beset me,
the Lord in His mercy did keep me.</p>

<p>I found that there were two thirsts in me&mdash;the
one after the creatures, to get help and
strength there, and the other after the Lord, the
Creator, and His Son Jesus Christ. I saw all the
world could do me no good; if I had had a king's diet,
palace, and attendance, all would have been as nothing;
for nothing gave me comfort but the Lord by
His power. At another time I saw the great love of
God, and was filled with admiration at the infiniteness
of it.</p>

<p>One day, when I had been walking solitarily abroad,
and was come home, I was taken up in the love of
God, so that I could not but admire the greatness of
His love; and while I was in that condition, it was
opened unto me by the eternal light and power, and
I therein clearly saw that all was done and to be
done in and by Christ, and how He conquers and destroys
this tempter the devil, and all his works, and
is atop of him; and that all these troubles were good
for me, and temptations for the trial of my faith,
which Christ had given me.</p>

<p>The Lord opened me, that I saw all through these
troubles and temptations. My living faith was
raised, that I saw all was done by Christ the life,
and my belief was in Him.</p>

<p>When at any time my condition was veiled, my secret
belief was stayed firm, and hope underneath held
me, as an anchor in the bottom of the sea, and anchored
my immortal soul to its Bishop, causing it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
swim above the sea, the world, where all the raging
waves, foul weather, tempests and temptations are.
But O! then did I see my troubles, trials, and temptations
more clearly than ever I had done. As the
light appeared all appeared that is out of the light;
darkness, death, temptations, the unrighteous, the
ungodly; all was manifest and seen in the light.</p>

<p>I heard of a woman in Lancashire that had fasted
two and twenty days, and I travelled to see her; but
when I came to her I saw that she was under a temptation.
When I had spoken to her what I had from
the Lord, I left her, her father being one high in profession.</p>

<p>Passing on, I went among the professors at
Duckingfield and Manchester, where I stayed awhile,
and declared truth among them. There were some
convinced who received the Lord's teaching, by which
they were confirmed and stood in the truth. But the
professors were in a rage, all pleading for sin and imperfection,
and could not endure to hear talk of perfection,
and of a holy and sinless life.<a name="FNanchor_20_31" id="FNanchor_20_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_31" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Lord's power was over all, though they were chained
under darkness and sin, which they pleaded for, and
quenched the tender thing in them.</p>

<p>About this time there was a great meeting of the
Baptists, at Broughton, in Leicestershire, with some
that had separated from them, and people of other
notions went thither, and I went also. Not many of
the Baptists came, but many others were there. The
Lord opened my mouth, and the everlasting truth
was declared amongst them, and the power of the
Lord was over them all. For in that day the Lord's
power began to spring, and I had great openings in
the Scriptures. Several were convinced in those
parts and were turned from darkness to light, from
the power of Satan unto God, and many were raised
up to praise God. When I reasoned with professors
and other people, some became convinced.</p>

<p>I went back into Nottinghamshire, and there the
Lord showed me that the natures of those things,
which were hurtful without, were within, in the
hearts and minds of wicked men. The natures of
dogs, swine, vipers, of Sodom and Egypt, Pharaoh,
Cain, Ishmael, Esau, etc.; the natures of these I saw
within, though people had been looking without. I
cried to the Lord, saying, "Why should I be thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_L_32" id="FNanchor_L_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_32" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
seeing I was never addicted to commit those evils?"
and the Lord answered, "That it was needful I
should have a sense of all conditions, how else should
I speak to all conditions!" and in this I saw the infinite
love of God.</p>

<p>I saw, also, that there was an ocean of darkness
and death; but an infinite ocean of light and love,
which flowed over the ocean of darkness. In that
also I saw the infinite love of God, and I had great
openings.</p>

<p>Then came people from far and near to see me;
but I was fearful of being drawn out by them; yet
I was made to speak, and open things to them.
There was one Brown, who had great prophecies and
sights upon his death-bed of me. He spoke only of
what I should be made instrumental by the Lord to
bring forth. And of others he spoke, that they
should come to nothing, which was fulfilled on some,
who then were something in show.</p>

<p>When this man was buried a great work of the
Lord fell upon me, to the admiration of many,
who thought I had been dead, and many came
to see me for about fourteen days. I was very
much altered in countenance and person, as if
my body had been new moulded or changed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_21_33" id="FNanchor_21_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_33" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
My sorrows and troubles began to wear off, and
tears of joy dropped from me, so that I could have
wept night and day with tears of joy to the Lord,
in humility and brokenness of heart.</p>

<p>I saw into that which was without end, things
which cannot be uttered, and of the greatness and infinitude
of the love of God, which cannot be expressed
by words. For I had been brought through
the very ocean of darkness and death, and through
and over the power of Satan, by the eternal, glorious
power of Christ; even through that darkness was I
brought, which covered over all the world, and which
chained down all and shut up all in death. The same
eternal power of God, which brought me through
these things, was that which afterwards shook the
nations, priests, professors and people.</p>

<p>Then could I say I had been in spiritual Babylon,
Sodom, Egypt, and the grave; but by the
eternal power of God I was come out of it,
and was brought over it, and the power of it, into the
power of Christ. I saw the harvest white, and the
seed of God lying thick in the ground, as ever did
wheat that was sown outwardly, and none to gather
it; for this I mourned with tears.</p>

<p>A report went abroad of me, that I was a young
man that had a discerning spirit; whereupon many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
came to me, from far and near, professors, priests,
and people. The Lord's power broke forth, and I
had great openings and prophecies, and spoke unto
them of the things of God, which they heard with attention
and silence, and went away and spread the
fame thereof.</p>

<p>Then came the tempter and set upon me again,
charging me that I had sinned against the Holy
Ghost; but I could not tell in what. Then Paul's
condition came before me, how after he had been
taken up into the third heaven, and seen things not
lawful to be uttered, a messenger of Satan was sent
to buffet him. Thus by the power of Christ I got
over that temptation also.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">The First Years of Ministry</p>

<h3>1648-1649.</h3>


<p>After this<a name="FNanchor_M_34" id="FNanchor_M_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_34" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> I went to Mansfield, where was a great
meeting of professors and people. Here I was moved
to pray; and the Lord's power was so great that the
house seemed to be shaken. When I had done, some
of the professors said it was now as in the days of the
apostles, when the house was shaken where they
were.<a name="FNanchor_22_35" id="FNanchor_22_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_35" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> After I had prayed, one of the professors
would pray, which brought deadness and a veil over
them; and others of the professors were grieved at
him and told him it was a temptation upon him.
Then he came to me, and desired that I would pray
again; but I could not pray in man's will.</p>

<p>Soon after there was another great meeting of professors,
and a captain, whose name was Amor Stoddard,
came in. They were discoursing of the blood
of Christ; and as they were discoursing of it, I saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
through the immediate opening of the invisible Spirit,
the blood of Christ. And I cried out among them,
and said, "Do ye not see the blood of Christ? See
it in your hearts, to sprinkle your hearts and consciences
from dead works, to serve the living God";
for I saw it, the blood of the New Covenant, how it
came into the heart.<a name="FNanchor_23_36" id="FNanchor_23_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_36" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This startled the professors, who would have the
blood only without them, and not in them. But
Captain Stoddard was reached, and said, "Let the
youth speak; hear the youth speak"; when he saw
they endeavoured to bear me down with many words.</p>

<p>There was also a company of priests, that were
looked upon to be tender; one of their names was
Kellett; and several people that were tender went to
hear them. I was moved to go after them, and bid
them mind the Lord's teaching in their inward parts.
That priest Kellett was against parsonages then; but
afterwards he got a great one, and turned a persecutor.</p>

<p>Now, after I had had some service in these parts,
I went through Derbyshire into my own county.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Leicestershire, again, and several tender people were
convinced.</p>

<p>Passing thence, I met with a great company
of professors in Warwickshire, who were praying,
and expounding the Scriptures in the fields.
They gave the Bible to me, and I opened it on the
fifth of Matthew, where Christ expounded the law;
and I opened the inward state to them, and the outward
state; upon which they fell into a fierce contention,
and so parted; but the Lord's power got ground.</p>

<p>Then I heard of a great meeting to be at Leicester,
for a dispute, wherein Presbyterians, Independents,
Baptists and Common-prayer-men<a name="FNanchor_N_37" id="FNanchor_N_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_37" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> were said to be
all concerned. The meeting was in a steeple-house;
and thither I was moved by the Lord God to go, and
be amongst them. I heard their discourse and reasonings,
some being in pews, and the priest in the
pulpit; abundance of people being gathered together.</p>

<p>At last one woman asked a question out of Peter,
What that birth was, viz., a being born again of incorruptible
seed, by the Word of God, that liveth and
abideth for ever? And the priest said to her, "I permit
not a woman to speak in the church"; though
he had before given liberty for any to speak.
Whereupon I was wrapped up, as in a rapture, in the
Lord's power; and I stepped up and asked the priest,
"Dost thou call this (the steeple-house) a church?
Or dost thou call this mixed multitude a church?"
For the woman asking a question, he ought to have
answered it, having given liberty for any to speak.</p>

<p>But, instead of answering me, he asked me what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
church was? I told him the church was the pillar
and ground of truth, made up of living stones, living
members, a spiritual household, which Christ was the
head of; but he was not the head of a mixed multitude,
or of an old house made up of lime, stones and
wood.<a name="FNanchor_24_38" id="FNanchor_24_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_38" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>This set them all on fire. The priest came down
from his pulpit, and others out of their pews,
and the dispute there was marred. I went to a great
inn, and there disputed the thing with the priests and
professors, who were all on fire. But I maintained
the true church, and the true head thereof, over their
heads, till they all gave out and fled away. One man
seemed loving, and appeared for a while to join with
me; but he soon turned against me, and joined with
a priest in pleading for infant-baptism, though himself
had been a Baptist before; so he left me alone.
Howbeit, there were several convinced that day; the
woman that asked the question was convinced, and
her family; and the Lord's power and glory shone
over all.</p>

<p>After this I returned into Nottinghamshire again,
and went into the Vale of Beavor.<a name="FNanchor_25_39" id="FNanchor_25_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_39" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> As I went, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
preached repentance to the people. There were many
convinced in the Vale of Beavor, in many towns; for
I stayed some weeks amongst them.</p>

<p>One morning, as I was sitting by the fire,
a great cloud came over me, and a temptation
beset me; and I sat still. It was said, "All
things come by nature"; and the elements and
stars came over me, so that I was in a manner quite
clouded with it. But as I sat still and said nothing,
the people of the house perceived nothing. And as I
sat still under it and let it alone, a living hope and a
true voice arose in me, which said, "There is a living
God who made all things."<a name="FNanchor_26_40" id="FNanchor_26_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_40" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Immediately the
cloud and temptation vanished away, and life rose
over it all; my heart was glad, and I praised the living
God.</p>

<p>After some time I met with some people who
had a notion that there was no God, but that all
things come by nature. I had a great dispute with
them, and overturned them, and made some of them
confess that there is a living God. Then I saw that
it was good that I had gone through that exercise.<a name="FNanchor_O_41" id="FNanchor_O_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_41" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>
We had great meetings in those parts; for the power
of the Lord broke through in that side of the country.</p>

<p>Returning into Nottinghamshire, I found there
a company of shattered Baptists, and others. The
Lord's power wrought mightily, and gathered many
of them. Afterwards I went to Mansfield and thereaway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
where the Lord's power was wonderfully manifested
both at Mansfield and other towns thereabouts.</p>

<p>In Derbyshire the mighty power of God wrought
in a wonderful manner. At Eton, a town near
Derby, there was a meeting of Friends,<a name="FNanchor_27_42" id="FNanchor_27_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_42" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> where
appeared such a mighty power of God that they were
greatly shaken, and many mouths were opened in the
power of the Lord God. Many were moved by the
Lord to go to steeple-houses, to the priests and people,
to declare the everlasting truth unto them.</p>

<p>At a certain time, when I was at Mansfield, there
was a sitting of the justices about hiring of servants;
and it was upon me from the Lord to go and speak
to the justices, that they should not oppress the servants
in their wages. So I walked towards the inn
where they sat; but finding a company of fiddlers
there, I did not go in, but thought to come in the
morning, when I might have a more serious opportunity
to discourse with them.</p>

<p>But when I came in the morning, they were gone,
and I was struck even blind, that I could not see. I
inquired of the innkeeper where the justices were to
sit that day; and he told me, at a town eight miles off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
My sight began to come to me again; and I went and
ran thitherward as fast as I could. When I was come
to the house where they were, and many servants
with them, I exhorted the justices not to oppress the
servants in their wages, but to do that which was
right and just to them; and I exhorted the servants
to do their duties, and serve honestly.<a name="FNanchor_28_43" id="FNanchor_28_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_43" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They all
received my exhortation kindly; for I was moved of
the Lord therein.</p>

<p>Moreover, I was moved to go to several courts and
steeple-houses at Mansfield, and other places, to warn
them to leave off oppression and oaths, and to turn
from deceit to the Lord, and to do justly. Particularly
at Mansfield, after I had been at a court there,
I was moved to go and speak to one of the most
wicked men in the country, one who was a common
drunkard, a noted whore-master, and a rhyme-maker;
and I reproved him in the dread of the
mighty God, for his evil courses.</p>

<p>When I had done speaking, and left him, he came
after me, and told me that he was so smitten when I
spoke to him, that he had scarcely any strength left
in him. So this man was convinced, and turned from
his wickedness, and remained an honest, sober man,
to the astonishment of the people who had known
him before.</p>

<p>Thus the work of the Lord went forward, and
many were turned from the darkness to the light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
within the compass of these three years, 1646, 1647
and 1648. Divers meetings of Friends, in several
places, were then gathered to God's teaching, by his
light, Spirit, and power; for the Lord's power broke
forth more and more wonderfully.</p>

<p>Now I was come up in spirit through the flaming
sword, into the paradise of God. All things were
new; and all the creation gave unto me another smell
than before, beyond what words can utter. I knew
nothing but pureness, and innocency, and righteousness;
being renewed into the image of God by Christ
Jesus, to the state of Adam, which he was in before
he fell. The creation was opened to me; and it was
showed me how all things had their names given
them according to their nature and virtue.</p>

<p>I was at a stand in my mind whether I should practise
physic for the good of mankind, seeing the
nature and virtues of things were so opened to me
by the Lord. But I was immediately taken up in
spirit to see into another or more steadfast state than
Adam's innocency, even into a state in Christ Jesus
that should never fall. And the Lord showed me
that such as were faithful to Him, in the power and
light of Christ, should come up into that state in
which Adam was before he fell; in which the admirable
works of the creation, and the virtues thereof,
may be known, through the openings of that divine
Word of wisdom and power by which they were
made.</p>

<p>Great things did the Lord lead me into, and wonderful
depths were opened unto me, beyond what can
by words be declared; but as people come into subjection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to the Spirit of God, and grow up in the
image and power of the Almighty, they may receive
the Word of wisdom that opens all things, and come
to know the hidden unity in the Eternal Being.<a name="FNanchor_29_44" id="FNanchor_29_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_44" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Thus I travelled on in the Lord's service, as He led
me. When I came to Nottingham, the mighty power
of God was there among Friends.<a name="FNanchor_30_45" id="FNanchor_30_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_45" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> From thence I
went to Clawson, in Leicestershire, in the Vale of
Beavor; and the mighty power of God appeared
there also, in several towns and villages where
Friends were gathered.</p>

<p>While I was there the Lord opened to me three
things relating to those three great professions in
the world,&mdash;law, physic, and divinity (so called). He
showed me that the physicians were out of the wisdom
of God, by which the creatures were made; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
knew not the virtues of the creatures, because they
were out of the Word of wisdom, by which they were
made. He showed me that the priests were out of
the true faith, of which Christ is the author,&mdash;the
faith which purifies, gives victory and brings people
to have access to God, by which they please God; the
mystery of which faith is held in a pure conscience.
He showed me also that the lawyers were out of the
equity, out of the true justice, and out of the law of
God, which went over the first transgression, and over
all sin, and answered the Spirit of God that was
grieved and transgressed in man; and that these
three,&mdash;the physicians, the priests, and the lawyers,&mdash;ruled
the world out of the wisdom, out of the
faith, and out of the equity and law of God; one pretending
the cure of the body, another the cure of the
soul, and the third the protection of the property of
the people. But I saw they were all out of the wisdom,
out of the faith, out of the equity and perfect
law of God.</p>

<p>And as the Lord opened these things unto me I
felt that His power went forth over all, by which all
might be reformed if they would receive and bow
unto it. The priests might be reformed and brought
into the true faith, which is the gift of God. The
lawyers might be reformed and brought into the law
of God, which answers that [indwelling Spirit] of
God<a name="FNanchor_31_46" id="FNanchor_31_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_46" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which is [in every one, is] transgressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
every one, and [which yet, if heeded] brings one to
love his neighbour as himself. This lets man see that
if he wrongs his neighbour, he wrongs himself; and
teaches him to do unto others as he would they
should do unto him. The physicians might be reformed
and brought into the wisdom of God, by
which all things were made and created; that they
might receive a right knowledge of the creatures,
and understand their virtues, which the Word of
wisdom, by which they were made and are upheld,
hath given them.</p>

<p>Abundance was opened concerning these things;
how all lay out of the wisdom of God, and out of the
righteousness and holiness that man at the first was
made in. But as all believe in the Light, and walk
in the Light,&mdash;that Light with which Christ hath
enlightened every man that cometh into the world,&mdash;and
become children of the Light, and of the day of
Christ, all things, visible and invisible, are seen, by
the divine Light of Christ, the spiritual heavenly
man, by whom all things were created.</p>

<p>Moreover, when I was brought up into His image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in righteousness and holiness, and into the paradise
of God He let me see how Adam was made a living
soul; and also the stature of Christ, the mystery that
had been hid from ages and generations: which
things are hard to be uttered, and cannot be borne by
many. For of all the sects in Christendom (so
called) that I discoursed with, I found none who
could bear to be told that any should come to Adam's
perfection,&mdash;into that image of God, that righteousness
and holiness, that Adam was in before he fell;
to be clean and pure, without sin, as he was. Therefore
how shall they be able to bear being told that
any shall grow up to the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ, when they cannot bear to hear
that any shall come, whilst upon earth, into the same
power and Spirit that the prophets and apostles were
in?&mdash;though it be a certain truth that none can understand
their writings aright without the same Spirit
by which they were written.</p>

<p>Now the Lord God opened to me by His invisible
power that every man was enlightened by the divine
Light of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_32_47" id="FNanchor_32_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_47" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and I saw it shine through all; and
that they that believed in it came out of condemnation
to the Light of life, and became the children
of it; but they that hated it, and did not believe in it,
were condemned by it, though they made a profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of Christ. This I saw in the pure openings of the
Light without the help of any man; neither did I
then know where to find it in the Scriptures; though
afterwards, searching the Scriptures, I found it. For
I saw, in that Light and Spirit which was before the
Scriptures were given forth, and which led the holy
men of God to give them forth, that all, if they
would know God or Christ, or the Scriptures aright,
must come to that Spirit by which they that gave
them forth were led and taught.</p>

<p>On a certain time, as I was walking in the fields,
the Lord said unto me, "Thy name is written in the
Lamb's book of life, which was before the foundation
of the world": and as the Lord spoke it, I
believed, and saw in it the new birth. Some time
after the Lord commanded me to go abroad into the
world, which was like a briery, thorny wilderness.
When I came in the Lord's mighty power with the
Word of life into the world, the world swelled, and
made a noise like the great raging waves of the sea.
Priests and professors, magistrates and people, were
all like a sea when I came to proclaim the day of the
Lord amongst them, and to preach repentance to
them.</p>

<p>I was sent to turn people from darkness to the
Light, that they might receive Christ Jesus; for to
as many as should receive Him in His light, I saw
He would give power to become the sons of God;
which power I had obtained by receiving Christ. I
was to direct people to the Spirit that gave forth the
Scriptures, by which they might be led into all truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and up to Christ and God, as those had been who
gave them forth.</p>

<p>Yet I had no slight esteem of the holy Scriptures.
They were very precious to me; for I was in that
Spirit by which they were given forth; and what the
Lord opened in me I afterwards found was agreeable
to them. I could speak much of these things, and
many volumes might be written upon them; but all
would prove too short to set forth the infinite love,
wisdom, and power of God, in preparing, fitting, and
furnishing me for the service to which He had
appointed me; letting me see the depths of Satan on
the one hand, and opening to me, on the other hand,
the divine mysteries of His own everlasting kingdom.</p>

<p>When the Lord God and His Son Jesus Christ
sent me forth into the world to preach His everlasting
gospel and kingdom, I was glad that I was commanded
to turn people to that inward Light, Spirit,
and Grace, by which all might know their salvation
and their way to God; even that Divine Spirit which
would lead them into all truth, and which I infallibly
knew would never deceive any.<a name="FNanchor_33_48" id="FNanchor_33_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_48" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But with and by this divine power and Spirit of
God, and the Light of Jesus, I was to bring people off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from all their own ways, to Christ, the new and living
way; and from their churches, which men had
made and gathered, to the Church in God, the general
assembly written in heaven, of which Christ is
the head. And I was to bring them off from the
world's teachers, made by men, to learn of Christ,
who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, of whom
the Father said, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye
Him"; and off from all the world's worships, to
know the Spirit of Truth in the inward parts, and
to be led thereby; that in it they might worship the
Father of spirits, who seeks such to worship Him.
And I saw that they that worshipped not in the
Spirit of Truth, knew not what they worshipped.</p>

<p>And I was to bring people off from all the world's
religions, which are vain, that they might know the
pure religion; might visit the fatherless, the widows,
and the strangers, and keep themselves from the
spots of the world. Then there would not be so
many beggars, the sight of whom often grieved my
heart, as it denoted so much hard-heartedness
amongst them that professed the name of Christ.</p>

<p>I was to bring them off from all the world's fellowships,
and prayings, and singings, which stood in
forms without power; that their fellowship might be
in the Holy Ghost, and in the Eternal Spirit of God;
that they might pray in the Holy Ghost, and sing in
the Spirit and with the grace that comes by Jesus;
making melody in their hearts to the Lord, who hath
sent His beloved Son to be their Saviour, and hath
caused His heavenly sun to shine upon all the world,
and His heavenly rain to fall upon the just and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
unjust, as His outward rain doth, fall, and His outward
sun doth shine on all.</p>

<p>I was to bring people off from Jewish ceremonies,
and from heathenish fables,<a name="FNanchor_34_49" id="FNanchor_34_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_49" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and from men's inventions
and worldly doctrines, by which they blew the
people about this way and the other, from sect to
sect; and from all their beggarly rudiments, with
their schools and colleges for making ministers of
Christ,&mdash;who are indeed ministers of their own making,
but not of Christ's; and from all their images,
and crosses, and sprinkling of infants, with all their
holy-days (so called), and all their vain traditions,
which they had instituted since the Apostles' days,
against all of which the Lord's power was set: in the
dread and authority of which power I was moved to
declare against them all, and against all that
preached and not freely, as being such as had not
received freely from Christ.</p>

<p>Moreover, when the Lord sent me forth into the
world, He forbade me to put off my hat to any, high
or low; and I was required to Thee and Thou all men
and women, without any respect to rich or poor,
great or small.<a name="FNanchor_35_50" id="FNanchor_35_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_50" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> And as I travelled up and down I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was not to bid people Good morrow, or Good evening;
neither might I bow or scrape with my leg to
any one; and this made the sects and professions to
rage. But the Lord's power carried me over all to
His glory, and many came to be turned to God in a
little time; for the heavenly day of the Lord sprung
from on high, and broke forth apace, by the light of
which many came to see where they were.</p>

<p>Oh, the blows, punchings, beatings, and imprisonments
that we underwent for not putting off our hats
to men! Some had their hats violently plucked off
and thrown away, so that they quite lost them. The
bad language and evil usage we received on this
account are hard to be expressed, besides the danger
we were sometimes in of losing our lives for this matter;
and that by the great professors of Christianity,
who thereby discovered they were not true believers.</p>

<p>And though it was but a small thing in the eye of
man, yet a wonderful confusion it brought among all
professors and priests; but, blessed be the Lord,
many came to see the vanity of that custom of putting
off the hat to men, and felt the weight of Truth's
testimony<a name="FNanchor_P_51" id="FNanchor_P_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_51" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> against it.</p>

<p>About this time I was sorely exercised in going to
their courts to cry for justice, in speaking and writing
to judges and justices to do justly; in warning
such as kept public houses for entertainment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they should not let people have more drink than
would do them good; in testifying against wakes,
feasts, May-games, sports, plays, and shows, which
trained up people to vanity and looseness, and led
them from the fear of God; and the days set forth
for holidays were usually the times wherein they
most dishonoured God by these things.</p>

<p>In fairs, also, and in markets, I was made to declare
against their deceitful merchandise, cheating, and
cozening; warning all to deal justly, to speak the
truth, to let their yea be yea, and their nay be nay,
and to do unto others as they would have others do
unto them; forewarning them of the great and terrible
day of the Lord, which would come upon them
all.</p>

<p>I was moved, also, to cry against all sorts of music,
and against the mountebanks playing tricks on their
stages; for they burthened the pure life, and stirred
up people's minds to vanity. I was much exercised,
too, with school-masters and school-mistresses, warning
them to teach children sobriety in the fear of the
Lord, that they might not be nursed and trained up
in lightness, vanity, and wantonness. I was made to
warn masters and mistresses, fathers and mothers in
private families, to take care that their children and
servants might be trained up in the fear of the Lord,
and that themselves should be therein examples and
patterns of sobriety and virtue to them.</p>

<p>The earthly spirit of the priests wounded my life;
and when I heard the bell toll to call people together
to the steeple-house, it struck at my life; for it was
just like a market-bell, to gather people together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that the priest might set forth his ware for sale. Oh,
the vast sums of money that are gotten by the trade
they make of selling the Scriptures, and by their
preaching, from the highest bishop to the lowest
priest! What one trade else in the world is comparable
to it? notwithstanding the Scriptures were
given forth freely, and Christ commanded His ministers
to preach freely, and the prophets and apostles
denounced judgment against all covetous hirelings
and diviners for money.</p>

<p>But in this free Spirit of the Lord Jesus was I sent
forth to declare the Word of life and reconciliation
freely, that all might come to Christ, who gives
freely, and who renews up into the image of God,
which man and woman were in before they fell, that
they might sit down in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish">The Challenge and the First Taste of Prison</p>

<h3>1648-1649.</h3>


<p>Now, as I went towards Nottingham, on a First-day,
in the morning, going with Friends to a meeting
there, when I came on the top of a hill in sight of the
town, I espied the great steeple-house. And the
Lord said unto me, "Thou must go cry against yonder
great idol, and against the worshippers therein."</p>

<p>I said nothing of this to the Friends that were
with me, but went on with them to the meeting,
where the mighty power of the Lord was amongst
us; in which I left Friends sitting in the meeting, and
went away to the steeple-house. When I came there,
all the people looked like fallow ground; and the
priest (like a great lump of earth) stood in his pulpit
above.</p>

<p>He took for his text these words of Peter, "We
have also a more sure Word of prophecy, whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
day-star arise in your hearts." And he told the people
that this was the Scriptures, by which they were
to try all doctrines, religions, and opinions.</p>

<p>Now the Lord's power was so mighty upon me, and
so strong in me, that I could not hold, but was made
to cry out and say, "Oh, no; it is not the Scriptures!"
and I told them what it was, namely, the
Holy Spirit, by which the holy men of God gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
forth the Scriptures, whereby opinions, religions, and
judgments were to be tried; for it led into all truth,
and so gave the knowledge of all truth. The Jews
had the Scriptures, and yet resisted the Holy Ghost,
and rejected Christ, the bright morning star. They
persecuted Christ and His apostles, and took upon
them to try their doctrines by the Scriptures; but
they erred in judgment, and did not try them aright,
because they tried without the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>As I spoke thus amongst them, the officers came
and took me away, and put me into a nasty, stinking
prison;<a name="FNanchor_36_52" id="FNanchor_36_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_52" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the smell whereof got so into my nose and
throat that it very much annoyed me.</p>

<p>But that day the Lord's power sounded so in their
ears that they were amazed at the voice, and could
not get it out of their ears for some time after, they
were so reached by the Lord's power in the steeple-house.
At night they took me before the mayor,
aldermen, and sheriffs of the town; and when I was
brought before them, the mayor was in a peevish,
fretful temper, but the Lord's power allayed him.
They examined me at large; and I told them how the
Lord had moved me to come. After some discourse
between them and me, they sent me back to prison
again. Some time after, the head sheriff, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
name was John Reckless, sent for me to his house.
When I came in, his wife met me in the hall, and
said, "Salvation is come to our house." She took me
by the hand, and was much wrought upon by the
power of the Lord God; and her husband, and children,
and servants were much changed, for the power
of the Lord wrought upon them.</p>

<p>I lodged at the sheriff's, and great meetings we had
in his house. Some persons of considerable condition
in the world came to them, and the Lord's power
appeared eminently amongst them.</p>

<p>This sheriff sent for the other sheriff, and for a
woman they had had dealings with in the way of
trade; and he told her, before the other sheriff, that
they had wronged her in their dealings with her (for
the other sheriff and he were partners), and that
they ought to make her restitution. This he spoke
cheerfully; but the other sheriff denied it, and the
woman said she knew nothing of it. But the friendly
sheriff said it was so, and that the other knew it well
enough; and having discovered the matter, and
acknowledged the wrong done by them, he made
restitution to the woman, and exhorted the other
sheriff to do the like. The Lord's power was with
this friendly sheriff, and wrought a mighty change
in him; and great openings he had.</p>

<p>The next market-day, as he was walking with me
in the chamber, he said, "I must go into the market,
and preach repentance to the people." Accordingly
he went in his slippers into the market, and into several
streets, and preached repentance to the people.
Several others also in the town were moved to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to the mayor and magistrates, and to the people,
exhorting them to repent. Hereupon the magistrates
grew very angry, sent for me from the sheriff's
house and committed me to the common prison.</p>

<p>When the assize came on, one person was moved
to come and offer up himself for me, body for body,
yea, life also; but when I should have been brought
before the judge, the sheriff's man being somewhat
long in bringing me to the sessions-house, the judge
was risen before I came. At which I understood the
judge was offended, and said, "I would have admonished
the youth if he had been brought before me":
for I was then imprisoned by the name of a youth.
So I was returned to prison again, and put into the
common jail.</p>

<p>The Lord's power was great among Friends; but
the people began to be very rude: wherefore the governor
of the castle sent soldiers, and dispersed them.
After that they were quiet. Both priests and people
were astonished at the wonderful power that
broke forth. Several of the priests were made tender,
and some did confess to the power of the Lord.</p>

<p>After I was set at liberty from Nottingham jail,
where I had been kept prisoner a pretty long time,
I travelled as before, in the work of the Lord.</p>

<p>Coming to Mansfield-Woodhouse, I found there a
distracted woman under a doctor's hand, with her
hair loose about her ears. He was about to let her
blood,<a name="FNanchor_37_53" id="FNanchor_37_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_53" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> she being first bound, and many people about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
her, holding her by violence; but he could get no
blood from her.</p>

<p>I desired them to unbind her and let her alone, for
they could not touch the spirit in her by which she
was tormented. So they did unbind her; and I was
moved to speak to her, and in the name of the Lord
to bid her be quiet; and she was so. The Lord's
power settled her mind, and she mended. Afterwards
she received the truth, and continued in it to
her death; and the Lord's name was honoured.</p>

<p>Many great and wonderful things were wrought by
the heavenly power in those days; for the Lord made
bare His omnipotent arm, and manifested His power,
to the astonishment of many, by the healing virtue
whereby many have been delivered from great
infirmities. And the devils were made subject
through His name; of which particular instances
might be given, beyond what this unbelieving age is
able to receive or bear.</p>

<p>Now while I was at Mansfield-Woodhouse, I was
moved to go to the steeple-house there, and declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the truth to the priest and people; but the people
fell upon me in great rage, struck me down, and almost
stifled and smothered me; and I was cruelly
beaten and bruised by them with their hands, and
with Bibles and sticks. Then they haled me out,
though I was hardly able to stand, and put me into
the stocks, where I sat some hours; and they brought
dog-whips and horse-whips, threatening to whip me.</p>

<p>After some time they had me before the magistrate,
at a knight's house, where were many great
persons; who, seeing how evilly I had been used,
after much threatening, set me at liberty. But the
rude people stoned me out of the town, for preaching
the Word of life to them.</p>

<p>I was scarcely able to move or stand by reason of
the ill usage I had received; yet with considerable
effort I got about a mile from the town, and then I
met with some people who gave me something to
comfort me, because I was inwardly bruised; but the
Lord's power soon healed me again. That day some
people were convinced of the Lord's truth, and
turned to His teaching, at which I rejoiced.</p>

<p>Then I went into Leicestershire, several Friends
accompanying me. There were some Baptists in that
country, whom I desired to see and speak with, because
they were separated from the public worship.
So one Oates, who was one of their chief teachers,
and others of the heads of them, with several others
of their company, came to meet us at Barrow; and
there we discoursed with them.</p>

<p>One of them said that what was not of faith was
sin, whereupon I asked them what faith was and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it was wrought in man. But they turned off from
that, and spoke of their baptism in water. Then I
asked them whether their mountain of sin was
brought down and laid low in them and their rough
and crooked ways made smooth and straight in them,&mdash;for
they looked upon the Scriptures as meaning
outward mountains and ways.<a name="FNanchor_38_54" id="FNanchor_38_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_54" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But I told them they
must find these things in their own hearts; at which
they seemed to wonder.</p>

<p>We asked them who baptized John the Baptist,
and who baptized Peter, John and the rest of the
apostles, and put them to prove by Scripture that
these were baptized in water; but they were silent.
Then I asked them, "Seeing Judas, who betrayed
Christ, and was called the son of perdition, had
hanged himself, what son of perdition was that
of which Paul spoke, that sat in the temple of God,
exalted above all that is called God? and what temple
of God was that in which this son of perdition
sat?" And I asked them whether he that betrays
Christ within himself be not one in nature with that
Judas that betrayed Christ without. But they could
not tell what to make of this, nor what to say to it.
So, after some discourse, we parted; and some of
them were loving to us.</p>

<p>On the First-day following we came to Bagworth,
and went to a steeple-house, where some Friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were got in, and the people locked them in, and
themselves, too, with the priest. But, after the
priest had done, they opened the door, and we went
in also, and had service for the Lord amongst them.
Afterwards we had a meeting in the town, amongst
several that were in high notions.</p>

<p>Passing thence, I heard of a people in prison at
Coventry for religion. As I walked towards the jail,
the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "My love
was always to thee, and thou art in my love." And
I was ravished with the sense of the love of God, and
greatly strengthened in my inward man. But when
I came into the jail where those prisoners were, a
great power of darkness struck at me; and I sat still,
having my spirit gathered into the love of God.</p>

<p>At last these prisoners began to rant, vapour, and
blaspheme; at which my soul was greatly grieved.
They said that they were God; but we could not
bear such things. When they were calm, I stood up
and asked them whether they did such things by motion,
or from Scripture. They said, "From Scripture."
Then, a Bible lying by, I asked them for that
Scripture; and they showed me that place where the
sheet was let down to Peter; and it was said to him
that what was sanctified he should not call common
or unclean. When I had showed them that that
Scripture made nothing for their purpose, they
brought another, which spake of God's reconciling
all things to Himself, things in heaven and things in
earth. I told them I owned that Scripture also; but
showed them that it likewise was nothing to their
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, seeing they said that they were God, I asked
them if they knew whether it would rain to-morrow.
They said they could not tell. I told them God could
tell. I asked them if they thought they should be
always in that condition, or should change. They
answered that they could not tell. "Then," said I,
"God can tell, and He doth not change. You say
you are God, and yet you cannot tell whether you
shall change or no." So they were confounded, and
quite brought down for the time.</p>

<p>After I had reproved them for their blasphemous
expressions, I went away; for I perceived they were
Ranters. I had met with none before; and I admired
the goodness of the Lord in appearing so unto me
before I went amongst them. Not long after this
one of these Ranters, whose name was Joseph
Salmon, published a recantation; upon which they
were set at liberty.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish">A Year in Derby Jail</p>

<h3>1650-1651.</h3>


<p>As I travelled through markets, fairs, and divers
places, I saw death and darkness in all people where
the power of the Lord God had not shaken them.
As I was passing on in Leicestershire I came to Twy-Cross,
where there were excise-men. I was moved
of the Lord to go to them, and warn them to take
heed of oppressing the poor; and people were much
affected with it.</p>

<p>There was in that town a great man that had long
lain sick, and was given up by the physicians; and
some Friends in the town desired me to go to see
him. I went up to him in his chamber, and spoke
the Word of life to him, and was moved to pray by
him; and the Lord was entreated, and restored him
to health. But when I was come down stairs, into a
lower room, and was speaking to the servants, and to
some people that were there, a serving-man of his
came raving out of another room, with a naked
rapier in his hand, and set it just to my side. I
looked steadfastly on him, and said, "Alack for thee,
poor creature! what wilt thou do with thy carnal
weapon? It is no more to me than a straw." The
bystanders were much troubled, and he went away
in a rage and full of wrath. But when the news of
it came to his master, he turned him out of his service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Lord's power preserved me and raised
up the weak man, who afterwards was very loving
to Friends; and when I came to that town again both
he and his wife came to see me.</p>

<p>After this I was moved to go into Derbyshire,
where the mighty power of God was among Friends.
And I went to Chesterfield, where one Britland was
priest. He saw beyond the common sort of priests,
for he had been partly convinced, and had spoken
much on behalf of Truth before he was priest there;
but when the priest of that town died, he got the parsonage,
and choked himself with it. I was moved to
speak to him and the people in the great love of God,
that they might come off from all men's teaching
unto God's teaching; and he was not able to gainsay.</p>

<p>But they had me before the mayor, and threatened
to send me, with some others, to the house of correction,
and kept us in custody till it was late in the
night. Then the officers, with the watchmen, put us
out of the town, leaving us to shift as we could. So
I bent my course towards Derby, having a friend or
two with me. In our way we met with many professors;
and at Kidsey Park many were convinced.</p>

<p>Then, coming to Derby, I lay at the house of a
doctor, whose wife was convinced; and so were several
more in the town. As I was walking in my
chamber, the [steeple-house] bell rang, and it struck
at my life at the very hearing of it; so I asked the
woman of the house what the bell rang for. She
said there was to be a great lecture there that day,
and many of the officers of the army, and priests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
preachers were to be there, and a colonel, that was a
preacher.</p>

<p>Then was I moved of the Lord to go up to them;
and when they had done I spoke to them what the
Lord commanded me, and they were pretty quiet.
But there came an officer and took me by the hand,
and said that I and the other two that were with me
must go before the magistrates. It was about the
first hour after noon that we came before them.</p>

<p>They asked me why we came thither. I said God
moved us so to do; and I told them, "God dwells
not in temples made with hands." I told them also
that all their preaching, baptism and sacrifices would
never sanctify them, and bade them look unto Christ
within them, and not unto men; for it is Christ that
sanctifies. Then they ran into many words; but I
told them they were not to dispute of God and
Christ, but to obey Him.<a name="FNanchor_39_55" id="FNanchor_39_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_55" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The power of God thundered among them, and
they did fly like chaff before it. They put me in and
out of the room often, hurrying me backward and
forward, for they were from the first hour till the
ninth at night in examining me. Sometimes they
would tell me in a deriding manner that I was taken
up in raptures.</p>

<p>At last they asked me whether I was sanctified.
I answered, "Yes; for I am in the paradise of God."
Then they asked me if I had no sin. I answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
"Christ my Saviour has taken away my sin; and in
Him there is no sin." They asked how we knew
that Christ did abide in us. I said, "By His Spirit,
that He hath given us." They temptingly asked if
any of us were Christ. I answered, "Nay; we are
nothing; Christ is all." They said, "If a man steal,
is it no sin?" I answered, "All unrighteousness is
sin."<a name="FNanchor_40_56" id="FNanchor_40_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_56" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>When they had wearied themselves in examining
me, they committed me and one other man to the
house of correction in Derby for six months, as blasphemers,<a name="FNanchor_41_57" id="FNanchor_41_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_57" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
as may appear by the mittimus, a copy
whereof here followeth:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the master of the house of correction in
Derby, greeting:</p>

<p>"We have sent you herewithal the bodies of
George Fox, late of Mansfield, in the county of Nottingham,
and John Fretwell, late of Staniesby, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the county of Derby, husbandman, brought before us
this present day, and charged with the avowed uttering
and broaching of divers blasphemous opinions,
contrary to the late Act of Parliament; which, upon
their examination before us, they have confessed.
These are therefore to require you forthwith, upon
sight hereof, to receive them, the said George Fox
and John Fretwell, into your custody, and them
therein safely to keep during the space of six months,
without bail or mainprize, or until they shall find
sufficient security to be of good behaviour, or be
thence delivered by order from ourselves. Hereof
you are not to fail. Given under our hands and seals
this 30th day of October, 1650.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>While I was here in prison divers professors came
to discourse with me. I had a sense, before they
spoke, that they came to plead for sin and imperfection.
I asked them whether they were believers and
had faith. They said, "Yes." I asked them, "In
whom?" They said, "In Christ." I replied. "If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ye are true believers in Christ, you are passed from
death to life; and if passed from death, then from
sin that bringeth death; and if your faith be true, it
will give you victory over sin and the devil, purify
your hearts and consciences (for the true faith is held
in a pure conscience), and bring you to please God,
and give you access to Him again."</p>

<p>But they could not endure to hear of purity, and
of victory over sin and the devil. They said they
could not believe any could be free from sin on this
side of the grave. I bade them give over babbling
about the Scriptures, which were holy men's words,
whilst they pleaded for unholiness.</p>

<p>At another time a company of professors came,
who also began to plead for sin. I asked them
whether they had hope. They said, "Yes: God forbid
but we should have hope." I asked them,
"What hope is it that you have? Is Christ in you the
hope of your glory? Doth it purify you, as He is
pure?" But they could not abide to hear of being
made pure here. Then I bade them forbear talking
of the Scriptures, which were the holy men's words;
"for," said I, "the holy men that wrote the Scriptures
pleaded for holiness in heart, life, and conversation
here; but since you plead for impurity and
sin, which is of the devil, what have you to do with
the holy men's words?"</p>

<p>The keeper of the prison, being a high professor,
was greatly enraged against me, and spoke very wickedly
of me; but it pleased the Lord one day to strike
him, so that he was in great trouble and under much
terror of mind. And, as I was walking in my chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
I heard a doleful noise, and, standing still, I
heard him say to his wife, "Wife, I have seen the
day of judgment, and I saw George there; and I was
afraid of him, because I had done him so much
wrong, and spoken so much against him to the ministers
and professors, and to the justices, and in taverns
and alehouses."</p>

<p>After this, towards the evening, he came into my
chamber, and said to me, "I have been as a lion
against you; but now I come like a lamb, and like the
jailer that came to Paul and Silas trembling." And
he desired he might lodge with me. I told him I
was in his power; he might do what he would; but he
said, "Nay," that he would have my leave, and that
he could desire to be always with me, but not to have
me as a prisoner. He said he had been plagued, and
his house had been plagued, for my sake. So I suffered
him to lodge with me.</p>

<p>Then he told me all his heart, and said that he believed
what I had said of the true faith and hope to
be true; and he wondered that the other man, who
was put in prison with me, did not stand it; and said,
"That man was not right, but you are an honest
man." He confessed also to me that at those times
when I had asked him to let me go forth to speak
the word of the Lord to the people, when he refused
to let me go, and I laid the weight thereof upon him,
he used to be under great trouble, amazed, and almost
distracted for some time after, and in such a
condition that he had little strength left him.</p>

<p>When the morning came he rose and went to the
justices, and told them that he and his house had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
plagued for my sake. One of the justices replied
(as he reported to me) that the plagues were upon
them, too, for keeping me. This was Justice Bennet,
of Derby, who was the first that called us Quakers,
because I bade them tremble at the word of the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_42_58" id="FNanchor_42_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_58" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> This was in the year 1650.</p>

<p>After this the justices gave leave that I should
have liberty to walk a mile. I perceived their end,
and told the jailer, that if they would set down to
me how far a mile was, I might take the liberty of
walking it sometimes. For I had a sense that they
thought I would go away. And the jailer confessed
afterwards they did it with that intent, to have me go
away, to ease them of their plague; but I told him I
was not of that spirit.</p>

<p>While I was in the house of correction my relations
came to see me; and, being troubled for my imprisonment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they went to the justices that cast me
into prison and desired to have me home with them,
offering to be bound in one hundred pounds, and
others of Derby in fifty pounds apiece with them,
that I should come no more thither to declare against
the priests.</p>

<p>So I was taken up before the justices; and because
I would not consent that they or any should be
bound for me (for I was innocent of any ill behaviour,
and had spoken the Word of life and truth
unto them), Justice Bennet rose up in a rage; and, as
I was kneeling down to pray to the Lord to forgive
him, he ran upon me, and struck me with both his
hands, crying, "Away with him, jailer; take him
away, jailer." Whereupon I was taken again to
prison, and there kept till the time of my commitment
for six months was expired.</p>

<p>But I had now the liberty of walking a mile by
myself, which I made use of as I felt freedom. Sometimes
I went into the market and streets, and warned
the people to repent of their wickedness, and returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to prison again. And there being persons of
several sorts of religion in the prison, I sometimes
visited them in their meetings on First-days.</p>

<p>While I was yet in the house of correction there
came unto me a trooper, and said that as he was sitting
in the steeple-house, hearing the priest, exceeding
great trouble fell upon him; and the voice of the
Lord came to him, saying, "Dost thou not know that
my servant is in prison? Go to him for direction."
So I spake to his condition, and his understanding
was opened. I told him that that which showed him
his sins, and troubled him for them, would show him
his salvation; for He that shows a man his sin is the
same that takes it away.</p>

<p>While I was speaking to him the Lord's power
opened his mind, so that he began to have a good understanding
in the Lord's truth, and to be sensible of
God's mercies. He spoke boldly in his quarters
amongst the soldiers, and to others, concerning truth
(for the Scriptures were very much opened to him),
insomuch that he said that his colonel was "as blind
as Nebuchadnezzar, to cast the servant of the Lord
into prison."</p>

<p>Upon this his colonel conceived a spite against
him, and at Worcester fight, the year after, when the
two armies lay near one another, and two came out
from the king's army and challenged any two of the
Parliament army to fight with them, his colonel
made choice of him and another to answer the challenge.
When in the encounter his companion was
slain, he drove both his enemies within musket-shot
of the town without firing a pistol at them. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
when he returned, he told me with his own mouth.
But when the fight was over he saw the deceit and
hypocrisy of the officers, and, being sensible how
wonderfully the Lord had preserved him, and seeing
also to the end of fighting, he laid down his arms.</p>

<p>The time of my commitment to the house of correction
being very nearly ended, and there being
many new soldiers raised, the commissioners would
have made me captain over them; and the soldiers
cried out that they would have none but me. So the
keeper of the house of correction was commanded to
bring me before the commissioners and soldiers in
the market-place, where they offered me that preferment,
as they called it, asking me if I would not take
up arms for the Commonwealth against Charles
Stuart. I told them I knew whence all wars arose,
even from the lusts, according to James' doctrine;
and that I lived in the virtue of that life and power
that took away the occasion of all wars.<a name="FNanchor_43_59" id="FNanchor_43_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_59" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Yet they courted me to accept of their offer, and
thought I did but compliment them. But I told
them I was come into the covenant of peace, which
was before wars and strifes were. They said they
offered it in love and kindness to me because of my
virtue; and such-like flattering words they used. But
I told them, if that was their love and kindness, I
trampled it under my feet.</p>

<p>Then their rage got up, and they said, "Take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
away, jailer, and put him into the prison amongst
the rogues and felons." So I was put into a lousy,
stinking place, without any bed, amongst thirty felons,
where I was kept almost half a year;<a name="FNanchor_44_60" id="FNanchor_44_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_60" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> yet at
times they would let me walk to the garden, believing
I would not go away.</p>

<p>When they had got me into Derby prison, it was
the saying of people that I would never come out;
but I had faith in God that I should be delivered in
His time; for the Lord had given me to believe that
I was not to be removed from that place yet, being
set there for a service which He had for me to do.</p>

<p>While I was here in prison there was a young
woman in the jail for robbing her master. When
she was to be tried for her life I wrote to the judge
and jury, showing them how contrary it was to the
law of God in old time to put people to death for
stealing, and moving them to show mercy. Yet she
was condemned to die, and a grave was made for her,
and at the time appointed she was carried forth to
execution. Then I wrote a few words, warning all
to beware of greediness or covetousness, for it leads
from God; and that all should fear the Lord, avoid
earthly lusts, and prize their time while they have it;
this I gave to be read at the gallows. And, though
they had her upon the ladder, with a cloth bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
over her face, ready to be turned off, yet they did
not put her to death, but brought her back to prison,
where she afterwards came to be convinced of God's
everlasting truth.</p>

<p>There was also in the jail, while I was there, a
wicked, ungodly man, who was reputed a conjurer.
He threatened that he would talk with me, and
boasted of what he would do; but he never had
power to open his mouth to me. And the jailer and
he falling out, he threatened to raise the devil and
break his house down; so that he made the jailer
afraid. I was moved of the Lord to go in His power
and rebuke him, and to say to him, "Come, let us
see what thou canst do; do thy worst." I told him
that the devil was raised high enough in him already;
but the power of God chained him down, so he slunk
away from me.</p>

<p>The time of Worcester fight coming on, Justice
Bennet sent constables to press me for a soldier, seeing
I would not voluntarily accept of a command. I
told them that I was brought off from outward wars.
They came again to give me press-money; but I
would take none. Then I was brought up to Sergeant
Holes, kept there awhile, and taken down
again. Afterwards the constables brought me a second
time before the commissioners, who said I
should go for a soldier; but I told them I was dead
to it. They said I was alive. I told them that where
envy and hatred is there is confusion. They offered
me money twice, but I refused it. Being disappointed,
they were angry, and committed me close
prisoner, without bail or mainprize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Great was the exercise and travail in spirit that I
underwent during my imprisonment here, because of
the wickedness that was in this town; for though
some were convinced, yet the generality were a
hardened people. I saw the visitation of God's love
pass away from them. I mourned over them.</p>

<p>There was a great judgment upon the town, and
the magistrates were uneasy about me; but they
could not agree what to do with me. One while they
would have sent me up to the Parliament; another
while they would have banished me to Ireland. At
first they called me a deceiver, a seducer and a blasphemer.
Afterwards, when God had brought his
plagues upon them, they styled me an honest, virtuous
man. But their good report and bad report were
nothing to me; for the one did not lift me up, nor the
other cast me down; praised be the Lord! At length
they were made to turn me out of jail, about the beginning
of winter, in the year 1651, after I had been
a prisoner in Derby almost a year,&mdash;six months in
the house of correction, and the rest of the time in
the common jail.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">One Man May Shake the Country for Ten Miles</p>

<h3>1651-1652.</h3>


<p>Being again at liberty, I went on, as before, in the
work of the Lord, passing through the country into
Leicestershire, having meetings as I went; and the
Lord's Spirit and power accompanied me.</p>

<p>As I was walking with several Friends, I lifted up
my head and saw three steeple-house spires, and they
struck at my life. I asked them what place that was.
They said, "Lichfield." Immediately the Word of
the Lord came to me that I must go thither. Being
come to the house we were going to, I wished the
Friends to walk into the house, saying nothing to
them of whither I was to go. As soon as they were
gone I stepped away, and went by my eye over hedge
and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield,
where, in a great field, shepherds were keeping their
sheep.</p>

<p>Then was I commanded by the Lord to pull off my
shoes. I stood still, for it was winter; and the Word
of the Lord was like a fire in me. So I put off my
shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the
poor shepherds trembled, and were astonished. Then
I walked on about a mile, and as soon as I was got
within the city, the Word of the Lord came to me
again, saying, "Cry, 'Woe to the bloody city of
Lichfield!'" So I went up and down the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
crying with a loud voice, "Woe to the bloody city
of Lichfield!" It being market-day, I went into
the market-place, and to and fro in the several parts
of it, and made stands, crying as before, "Woe to
the bloody city of Lichfield!" And no one laid
hands on me.</p>

<p>As I went thus crying through the streets, there
seemed to me to be a channel of blood running down
the streets, and the market-place appeared like a pool
of blood.</p>

<p>When I had declared what was upon me, and
felt myself clear, I went out of the town in peace,
and, returning to the shepherds, I gave them some
money, and took my shoes of them again. But the
fire of the Lord was so in my feet, and all over me,
that I did not matter to put on my shoes again, and
was at a stand whether I should or no, till I felt freedom
from the Lord so to do; then, after I had washed
my feet, I put on my shoes again.</p>

<p>After this a deep consideration came upon me,
for what reason I should be sent to cry against that
city, and call it the bloody city! For, though the
Parliament had had the minster one while, and the
King another, and much blood had been shed in the
town during the wars between them, yet that was
no more than had befallen many other places. But
afterwards I came to understand, that in the Emperor
Diocletian's time a thousand Christians were
martyred in Lichfield.<a name="FNanchor_45_61" id="FNanchor_45_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_61" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>Passing on, I was moved of the Lord to go to Beverley
steeple-house, which was then a place of high
profession; and being very wet with rain, I went first
to an inn. As soon as I came to the door, a young
woman of the house came to the door, and said,
"What, is it you? come in," as if she had known me
before; for the Lord's power bowed their hearts. So
I refreshed myself and went to bed; and in the morning,
my clothes being still wet, I got ready, and having
paid for what I had had in the inn, I went up to
the steeple-house, where was a man preaching.
When he had done, I was moved to speak to him, and
to the people, in the mighty power of God, and to
turn them to their teacher, Christ Jesus. The power
of the Lord was so strong, that it struck a mighty
dread amongst the people. The mayor came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
spoke a few words to me; but none of them had any
power to meddle with me.</p>

<p>So I passed away out of the town, and in the afternoon
went to another steeple-house about two miles
off. When the priest had done, I was moved to speak
to him, and to the people very largely, showing them
the way of life and truth, and the ground of election
and reprobation. The priest said he was but a child,
and could not dispute with me. I told him I did not
come to dispute, but to hold forth the Word of life
and truth unto them, that they might all know the
one Seed, to which the promise of God was given,
both in the male and in the female. Here the people
were very loving, and would have had me come again
on a week-day, and preach among them; but I
directed them to their teacher, Christ Jesus, and so
passed away.</p>

<p>The next day I went to Cranswick, to Captain Pursloe's,
who accompanied me to Justice Hotham's.
This Justice Hotham was a tender man, one that had
had some experience of God's workings in his heart.
After some discourse with him of the things of God,
he took me into his closet, where, sitting with me, he
told me he had known that principle<a name="FNanchor_Q_62" id="FNanchor_Q_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_62" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> these ten years,
and was glad that the Lord did now publish it abroad
to the people. After a while there came a priest to
visit him, with whom also I had some discourse concerning
the Truth. But his mouth was quickly
stopped, for he was nothing but a notionist, and not
in possession of what he talked of.</p>

<p>While I was here, there came a great woman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Beverley to speak to Justice Hotham about some
business; and in discourse she told him that the last
Sabbath-day (as she called it) there came an angel or
spirit into the church at Beverley, and spoke the
wonderful things of God, to the astonishment of all
that were there; and when it had done, it passed
away, and they did not know whence it came, nor
whither it went; but it astonished all,&mdash;priest, professors,
and magistrates of the town. This relation
Justice Hotham gave me afterwards, and then I gave
him an account of how I had been that day at Beverley
steeple-house, and had declared truth to the priest
and people there.</p>

<p>I went to another steeple-house about three miles
off, where preached a great high-priest, called a doctor,
one of them whom Justice Hotham would have
sent for to speak with me. I went into the steeple-house,
and stayed till the priest had done. The words
which he took for his text were these, "Ho, every
one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that
hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy
wine and milk without money and without price."</p>

<p>Then was I moved of the Lord God to say unto
him, "Come down, thou deceiver; dost thou bid people
come freely, and take of the water of life freely,
and yet thou takest three hundred pounds a year of
them for preaching the Scriptures to them. Mayest
thou not blush for shame? Did the prophet Isaiah,
and Christ do so, who spoke the words, and gave
them forth freely? Did not Christ say to His ministers,
whom He sent to preach, 'Freely ye have received,
freely give'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest, like a man amazed, hastened away.
After he had left his flock, I had as much time as I
could desire to speak to the people; and I directed
them from the darkness to the Light, and to the
grace of God, that would teach them, and bring
them salvation; to the Spirit of God in their inward
parts, which would be a free teacher unto them.</p>

<p>Having cleared myself amongst the people, I
returned to Justice Hotham's house that night.
When I came in he took me in his arms, and said his
house was my house; for he was exceedingly glad of
the work of the Lord, and that His power was
revealed.</p>

<p>Thence I passed on through the country, and
came at night to an inn where was a company of rude
people. I bade the woman of the house, if she had
any meat, to bring me some; but because I said Thee
and Thou to her, she looked strangely on me. I asked
her if she had any milk. She said, No. I was sensible
she spake falsely; and, being willing to try her
further, I asked her if she had any cream? She
denied that she had any.</p>

<p>There stood a churn in the room, and a little boy,
playing about, put his hands into it and pulled it
down, and threw all the cream on the floor before
my eyes. Thus was the woman manifested to be a
liar. She was amazed, blessed herself, took up the
child, and whipped it sorely: but I reproved her for
her lying and deceit. After the Lord had thus discovered
her deceit and perverseness, I walked out of
the house, and went away till I came to a stack of
hay, and lay in the hay-stack that night, in rain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
snow, it being but three days before the time called
Christmas.</p>

<p>The next day I came into York, where were several
very tender people. Upon the First-day following,
I was commanded of the Lord to go and speak
to priest Bowles and his hearers in their great cathedral.
Accordingly I went. When the priest had
done, I told them I had something from the Lord
God to speak to the priest and people. "Then say
on quickly," said a professor, for there was frost and
snow, and it was very cold weather. Then I told
them that this was the Word of the Lord God unto
them,&mdash;that they lived in words, but God Almighty
looked for fruits amongst them.</p>

<p>As soon as the words were out of my mouth, they
hurried me out, and threw me down the steps. But
I got up again without hurt, and went to my lodging,
and several were convinced there. For that which
arose from the weight and oppression that was upon
the Spirit of God in me, would open people, strike
them, and make them confess that the groans which
broke forth through me did reach them, for my
life was burthened with their profession without possession,
and their words without fruit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[After being thus violently tumbled down the steps
of the great minster, George Fox found his next few
days crowded with hot discussion. Papists and Ranters
and Scotch "priests" made him stand forth for the
hope that was in him. The Ranters, he says, "had
spent their portions, and not living in that which they
spake of, were now become dry. They had some kind
of meetings, but they took tobacco and drank ale in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
their meetings and were grown light and loose." After
the narrative of an attempt to push him over the cliffs
the account continues.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Another priest sent to have a dispute with me,
and Friends went with me to the house where he
was; but when he understood we were come, he
slipped out of the house, and hid himself under an
hedge. The people went and found him, but could
not get him to come to us.</p>

<p>Then I went to a steeple-house hard by, where the
priest and people were in a great rage. This priest
had threatened Friends what he would do; but when
I came he fled; for the Lord's power came over him
and them. Yea, the Lord's everlasting power was
over the world, and reached to the hearts of people,
and made both priests and professors tremble.
It shook the earthly and airy spirit in which they
held their profession of religion and worship; so that
it was a dreadful thing to them when it was told
them, "The man in leathern breeches is come."<a name="FNanchor_46_63" id="FNanchor_46_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_63" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
At the hearing thereof the priests in many places got
out of the way, they were so struck with the dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the eternal power of God; and fear surprised the
hypocrites.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[At Pickering he stood in "the steeple-house yard"
and told the people what his mission was, with as clear
a claim to a divine commission as a Hebrew prophet
would have made.]</p></blockquote>

<p>I was sent of the Lord God of heaven and earth to
preach freely, and to bring people off from these outward
temples made with hands, which God dwelleth
not in; that they might know their bodies to become
the temples of God and of Christ; and to draw people
off from all their superstitious ceremonies, Jewish
and heathenish customs, traditions, and doctrines of
men; and from all the world's hireling teachers, that
take tithes and great wages, preaching for hire, and
divining for money, whom God and Christ never
sent, as themselves confess when they say that they
never heard God's nor Christ's voice. I exhorted the
people to come off from all these things, directing
them to the Spirit and grace of God in themselves,
and to the Light of Jesus in their own hearts; that
they might come to know Christ, their free teacher,
to bring them salvation, and to open the Scriptures
to them.</p>

<p>Thus the Lord gave me a good opportunity to open
things largely unto them. All was quiet, and many
were convinced; blessed be the Lord.</p>

<p>I passed to another town, where was another great
meeting, the old priest being with me; and there
came professors of several sorts to it. I sat on a hay-stack,
and spoke nothing for some hours; for I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to famish them from words. The professors would
ever and anon be speaking to the old priest, and
asking him when I would begin, and when I would
speak? He bade them wait; and told them that the
people waited upon Christ a long while before He
spoke.</p>

<p>At last I was moved of the Lord to speak; and
they were struck by the Lord's power. The Word
of life reached to them, and there was a general convincement
amongst them.</p>

<p>Now I came towards Cranswick, to Captain Pursloe's
and Justice Hotham's, who received me kindly,
being glad that the Lord's power had so appeared;
that truth was spread, and so many had received it.
Justice Hotham said that if God had not raised up
this principle of Light and life which I preached, the
nation would have been overrun with Ranterism,<a name="FNanchor_47_64" id="FNanchor_47_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_64" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
and all the justices in the nation could not have
stopped it with all their laws; "Because," said he,
"they would have said as we said, and done as we
commanded, and yet have kept their own principle
still. But this principle of truth," said he, "overthrows
their principle, and the root and ground
thereof"; and therefore he was glad the Lord had
raised up this principle of life and truth.</p>

<p>The next day Friends and friendly people having
left me, I travelled alone, declaring the day of the
Lord amongst people in the towns where I came, and
warning them to repent. I came towards night into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a town called Patrington. As I walked along the
town, I warned both priest and people (for the priest
was in the street) to repent and turn to the Lord. It
grew dark before I came to the end of the town, and
a multitude of people gathered about me, to whom I
declared the Word of life.</p>

<p>When I had cleared myself I went to an inn, and
desired them to let me have a lodging; but they
would not. I desired a little meat or milk, and said
I would pay for it; but they refused. So I walked
out of the town, and a company of fellows followed,
and asked me, "What news?" I bade them repent,
and fear the Lord.</p>

<p>After I was gone a pretty way, I came to another
house, and desired the people to let me have a little
meat, drink, and lodging for my money; but they
denied me. I went to another house, and desired the
same; but they refused me also. By this time it was
grown so dark that I could not see the highway; but
I discerned a ditch, and got a little water, and
refreshed myself. Then I got over the ditch; and,
being weary with travelling, I sat down amongst the
furze bushes till it was day.</p>

<p>About break of day I got up, and passed on over
the fields. A man came after me with a great pike-staff
and went along with me to a town; and he
raised the town upon me, with the constable and
chief constable, before the sun was up. I declared
God's everlasting truth amongst them, warning them
of the day of the Lord, that was coming upon all sin
and wickedness; and exhorted them to repent. But
they seized me, and had me back to Patrington, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
three miles, guarding me with watch-bills, pikes,
staves, and halberds.</p>

<p>When I was come to Patrington, all the town was
in an uproar, and the priest and constables were consulting
together; so I had another opportunity to
declare the Word of life amongst them, and warn
them to repent. At last a professor, a tender man,
called me into his house, and there I took a little
milk and bread, having not eaten for some days
before. Then they guarded me about nine miles to
a justice.</p>

<p>When I was come near his house, a man came riding
after us, and asked me whether I was the man
that was apprehended. I asked him wherefore he
asked. He said, "For no hurt." I told him I was: so
he rode away to the justice before us. The men that
guarded me said it would be well if the justice were
not drunk before we got to him; for he used to get
drunk early.</p>

<p>When I was brought in before him, because I did
not put off my hat, and because I said Thou to him,
he asked the man that rode thither before me
whether I was not mazed or fond.<a name="FNanchor_R_65" id="FNanchor_R_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_65" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> The man told
him, No; it was my principle.</p>

<p>I warned him to repent, and come to the light
with which Christ had enlightened him; that by it
he might see all his evil words and actions, and turn
to Christ Jesus whilst he had time; and that whilst
he had time he should prize it. "Ay, ay," said he,
"the Light that is spoken of in the third of John."
I desired he would mind it, and obey it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>As I admonished him, I laid my hand upon him,
and he was brought down by the power of the Lord;
and all the watchmen stood amazed. Then he took
me into a little parlour with the other man, and
desired to see what I had in my pockets of letters or
intelligence. I plucked out my linen, and showed
him I had no letters. He said, "He is not a vagrant,
by his linen"; then he set me at liberty.</p>

<p>I went back to Patrington with the man that had
rode before me to the justice: for he lived at Patrington.
When I came there, he would have had me have
a meeting at the Cross; but I said it was no matter;
his house would serve. He desired me to go to bed,
or lie down upon a bed; which he did, that they
might say they had seen me in a bed, or upon a bed;
for a report had been raised that I would not lie on
any bed, because at that time I lay many times out
of doors.<a name="FNanchor_48_66" id="FNanchor_48_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_66" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Now when the First-day of the week was
come, I went to the steeple-house, and declared the
truth to the priest and people; and the people did
not molest me, for the power of God was come over
them. Presently after I had a great meeting at the
man's house where I lay, and many were convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the Lord's everlasting truth, who stand faithful
witnesses of it to this day. They were exceedingly
grieved that they had not received me, nor given me
lodging, when I was there before.</p>

<p>Thence I travelled through the country, even to
the furthest part thereof, warning people, in towns
and villages, to repent, and directing them to Christ
Jesus, their teacher.</p>

<p>On the First-day of the week I came to one
Colonel Overton's house, and had a great meeting of
the prime of the people of that country; where many
things were opened out of the Scriptures which they
had never heard before. Many were convinced, and
received the Word of life, and were settled in the
truth of God.</p>

<p>Then I returned to Patrington again, and visited
those Friends that were convinced there; by whom I
understood that a tailor, and some wild blades in that
town, had occasioned my being carried before the justice.
The tailor came to ask my forgiveness, fearing I
would complain of him. The constables also were
afraid, lest I should trouble them. But I forgave
them all, and warned them to turn to the Lord, and
to amend their lives.</p>

<p>Now that which made them the more afraid was
this: when I was in the steeple-house at Oram, not
long before, there came a professor, who gave me a
push on the breast in the steeple-house, and bade me
get out of the church. "Alas, poor man!" said I,
"dost thou call the steeple-house the Church? The
Church is the people, whom God hath purchased with
His blood, and not the house." It happened that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Justice Hotham came to hear of this man's abuse,
sent his warrant for him, and bound him over to the
sessions; so affected was he with the Truth and so
zealous to keep the peace. And indeed this Justice
Hotham had asked me before whether any people
had meddled with me, or abused me; but I was not at
liberty to tell him anything of that kind, but was to
forgive all.</p>

<p>The next First-day I went to Tickhill, whither the
Friends of that side gathered together, and a mighty
brokenness by the power of God there was amongst
the people. I went out of the meeting, being moved
of God to go to the steeple-house. When I came
there, I found the priest and most of the chief of the
parish together in the chancel.</p>

<p>I went up to them, and began to speak; but they
immediately fell upon me; the clerk up with his
Bible, as I was speaking, and struck me on the face
with it, so that my face gushed out with blood; and
I bled exceedingly in the steeple-house. The people
cried, "Let us have him out of the church." When
they had got me out, they beat me exceedingly, threw
me down, and turned me over a hedge. They afterwards
dragged me through a house into the street,
stoning and beating me as they dragged me along; so
that I was all over besmeared with blood and dirt.
They got my hat from me, which I never had again.
Yet when I was got upon my legs, I declared the
Word of life, showed them the fruits of their
teacher, and how they dishonored Christianity.</p>

<p>After awhile I got into the meeting again amongst
Friends, and the priest and people coming by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
house, I went with Friends into the yard, and there
spoke to the priest and people. The priest scoffed at
us, and called us Quakers. But the Lord's power was
so over them, and the Word of life was declared in
such authority and dread to them, that the priest fell
a-trembling himself; and one of the people said,
"Look how the priest trembles and shakes; he is
turned a Quaker also."</p>

<p>When the meeting was over, Friends departed;
and I went without my hat to Balby, about seven or
eight miles. Friends were much abused that day by
the priest and his people: insomuch that some moderate
justices hearing of it, two or three of them
came and sat at the town to examine the business.
He that had shed my blood was afraid of having his
hand cut off for striking me in the church, as they
called it; but I forgave him, and would not appear
against him.</p>

<p>Thence I went to Wakefield; and on the First-day
after, I went to a steeple-house where James Nayler<a name="FNanchor_49_67" id="FNanchor_49_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_67" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
had been a member of an Independent church;
but upon his receiving truth, he was excommunicated.
When I came in, and the priest had done, the
people called upon me to come up to the priest, which
I did; but when I began to declare the Word of life
to them, and to lay open the deceit of the priest, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
rushed upon me suddenly, thrust me out at the other
door, punching and beating me, and cried, "Let us
have him to the stocks." But the Lord's power restrained
them, that they were not suffered to put
me in.</p>

<p>So I passed away to the meeting, where were a
great many professors and friendly people gathered,
and a great convincement there was that day; for the
people were mightily satisfied that they were directed
to the Lord's teaching <em>in themselves</em>. Here we got
some lodging; for four of us had lain under a hedge
the night before, there being then few Friends in
that place.</p>

<p>The priest of that church, of which James Nayler
had been a member, whose name was Marshall,
raised many wicked slanders about me, as that I carried
bottles with me, and made people drink of them,
which made them follow me; and that I rode upon a
great black horse, and was seen in one country upon
it in one hour, and at the same hour in another country
threescore miles off; and that I would give a fellow
money to follow me, when I was on my black
horse. With these lies he fed his people, to make
them think evil of the truth which I had declared
amongst them. But by these lies he preached many
of his hearers away from him; for I was then travelling
on foot, and had no horse at that time; which
the people generally knew.</p>

<p>As we travelled through the country, preaching
repentance to the people, we came into a market-town,
where a lecture was held that day. I went into
the steeple-house, where many priests, professors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
people were. The priest that preached took for his
text those words of Jeremiah 5:31, "My people love
to have it so": leaving out the foregoing words, viz.:
"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear
rule by their means." I showed the people his deceit;
and directed them to Christ, the true teacher within;
declaring that God was come to teach His people
himself, and to bring them off from all the world's
teachers and hirelings; that they might come to
receive freely from Him. Then, warning them of
the day of the Lord that was coming upon all flesh,
I passed thence without much opposition.</p>

<p>At night we came to a country place, where there
was no public house near. The people desired us to
stay all night; which we did, and had good service
for the Lord, declaring His truth amongst them.</p>

<p>The Lord had said unto me that if but one man or
woman were raised by His power to stand and live
in the same Spirit that the prophets and apostles
were in who gave forth the Scriptures, that man or
woman should shake all the country in their profession<a name="FNanchor_S_68" id="FNanchor_S_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_68" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>
for ten miles round. For people had the Scriptures,
but were not in the same Light, power, and
Spirit which those were in who gave forth the Scriptures;
so they neither knew God, Christ, nor the
Scriptures aright; nor had they unity one with
another, being out of the power and Spirit of God.
Therefore we warned all, wherever we met them, of
the day of the Lord that was coming upon them.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">A New Era Begins</p>

<h3>1652.</h3>


<p>As we travelled we came near a very great hill,
called Pendle Hill, and I was moved of the Lord to
go up to the top of it; which I did with difficulty, it
was so very steep and high. When I was come to
the top, I saw the sea bordering upon Lancashire.
From the top of this hill the Lord let me see in what
places he had a great people to be gathered. As I
went down, I found a spring of water in the side of
the hill, with which I refreshed myself, having eaten
or drunk but little for several days before.<a name="FNanchor_50_69" id="FNanchor_50_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_69" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>At night we came to an inn, and declared truth to
the man of the house, and wrote a paper to the priests
and professors, declaring the day of the Lord, and
that Christ was come to teach people Himself, by His
power and Spirit in their hearts, and to bring people
off from all the world's ways and teachers, to His
own free teaching, who had bought them, and was
the Saviour of all them that believed in Him. The
man of the house spread the paper abroad, and was
mightily affected with the truth. Here the Lord
opened unto me, and let me see a great people in
white raiment by a river side, coming to the Lord;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and the place that I saw them in was about Wensleydale
and Sedbergh.<a name="FNanchor_51_70" id="FNanchor_51_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_70" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The next day we travelled on, and at night got a
little fern or bracken to put under us, and lay upon
a common. Next morning we reached a town, where
Richard Farnsworth<a name="FNanchor_52_71" id="FNanchor_52_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_71" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> parted from me; and then I
travelled alone again. I came up Wensleydale, and
at the market-town in that Dale, there was a lecture
on the market-day. I went into the steeple-house;
and after the priest had done I proclaimed the day
of the Lord to the priest and people, warning them
to turn from darkness to the Light, and from the
power of Satan unto God, that they might come to
know God and Christ aright, and to receive His
teaching, who teacheth freely. Largely and freely
did I declare the Word of life unto them, and had
not much persecution there.</p>

<p>Afterwards I passed up the Dales, warning people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to fear God, and preaching the everlasting gospel to
them. In my way I came to a great house, where
was a schoolmaster; and they got me into the house.
I asked them questions about their religion and worship;
and afterwards I declared the truth to them.
They had me into a parlour, and locked me in, pretending
that I was a young man that was mad, and
had run away from my relations; and that they
would keep me till they could send to them. But I
soon convinced them of their mistake, and they let
me forth, and would have had me to stay; but I was
not to stay there.</p>

<p>Then having exhorted them to repentance, and
directed them to the Light of Christ Jesus, that
through it they might come unto Him and be saved,
I passed from them, and came in the night to a little
ale-house on a common, where there was a company
of rude fellows drinking. Because I would not drink
with them, they struck me with their clubs; but I
reproved them, and brought them to be somewhat
cooler; and then I walked out of the house upon the
common in the night.</p>

<p>After some time one of these drunken fellows
came out, and would have come close up to me, pretending
to whisper to me; but I perceived he had a
knife; and therefore I kept off him, and bade him
repent, and fear God. So the Lord by His power
preserved me from this wicked man; and he went
into the house again. The next morning I went on
through other Dales, warning and exhorting people
everywhere as I passed, to repent and turn to the
Lord: and several were convinced. At one house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that I came to, the man of the house (whom I afterwards
found to be a kinsman of John Blakelin's)
would have given me money, but I would not receive
it.</p>

<p>The next day I went to a meeting at Justice Benson's,
where I met a people that were separated from
the public worship. This was the place I had seen,
where a people came forth in white raiment. A large
meeting it was, and the people were generally convinced;
and they continue still a large meeting of
Friends near Sedbergh; which was then first gathered
through my ministry in the name of Jesus.</p>

<p>In the same week there was a great fair, at which
servants used to be hired; and I declared the day of
the Lord through the fair. After I had done so, I
went into the steeple-house yard, and many of the
people of the fair came thither to me, and abundance
of priests and professors. There I declared the everlasting
truth of the Lord and the Word of life for
several hours, showing that the Lord was come to
teach His people Himself, and to bring them off
from all the world's ways and teachers, to Christ, the
true teacher, and the true way to God. I laid open
their teachers, showing that they were like them that
were of old condemned by the prophets, and by
Christ, and by the apostles. I exhorted the people to
come off from the temples made with hands; and
wait to receive the Spirit of the Lord, that they
might know themselves to be the temples of God.</p>

<p>Not one of the priests had power to open his
mouth against what I declared: but at last a captain
said, "Why will you not go into the church? this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not a fit place to preach in." I told him I denied
their church. Then stood up Francis Howgill, who
was preacher to a congregation. He had not seen me
before; yet he undertook to answer that captain; and
he soon put him to silence. Then said Francis Howgill
of me, "This man speaks with authority, and not
as the scribes."</p>

<p>After this, I opened to the people that that ground
and house were no holier than another place; and
that the house is not the Church, but the people, of
whom Christ is the head. After awhile the priests
came up to me, and I warned them to repent. One
of them said I was mad; so they turned away. But
many were convinced there that day, who were glad
to hear the truth declared, and received it with joy.
Amongst these was Captain Ward, who received the
truth in the love of it, and lived and died in it.</p>

<p>The next First-day I came to Firbank chapel in
Westmoreland, where Francis Howgill and John
Audland<a name="FNanchor_53_72" id="FNanchor_53_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_72" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> had been preaching in the morning. The
chapel was full of people, so that many could not get
in. Francis said he thought I looked into the chapel,
and his spirit was ready to fail, the Lord's power did
so surprise him: but I did not look in. They made
haste, and had quickly done, and they and some of
the people went to dinner; but abundance stayed till
they came again. John Blakelin and others came to
me, and desired me not to reprove them publicly; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
they were not parish-teachers, but pretty tender men.
I could not tell them whether I should or no, though
I had not at that time any drawings to declare publicly
against them; but I said they must leave me to
the Lord's movings.</p>

<p>While others were gone to dinner, I went to a
brook, got a little water, and then came and sat down
on the top of a rock hard by the chapel. In the afternoon
the people gathered about me, with several of
their preachers. It was judged there were above a
thousand people; to whom I declared God's everlasting
truth and Word of life freely and largely for
about the space of three hours. I directed all to the
Spirit of God in themselves; that they might be
turned from darkness to Light, and believe in it; that
they might become the children of it, and might be
turned from the power of Satan unto God; and by
the Spirit of truth might be led into all truth, and
sensibly understand the words of the prophets, of
Christ, and of the apostles; and might all come to
know Christ to be their teacher to instruct them,
their counsellor to direct them, their shepherd to
feed them, their bishop to oversee them, and their
prophet to open divine mysteries to them; and might
know their bodies to be prepared, sanctified, and
made fit temples for God and Christ to dwell in. In
the openings of heavenly life I explained unto them
the prophets, and the figures and shadows, and
directed them to Christ, the substance. Then I
opened the parables and sayings of Christ, and things
that had been long hid.</p>

<p>Now there were many old people who went into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the chapel and looked out at the windows, thinking
it a strange thing to see a man preach on a hill, and
not in their church, as they called it; whereupon I
was moved to open to the people that the steeple-house,
and the ground whereon it stood were no more
holy than that mountain; and that those temples,
which they called the dreadful houses of God were
not set up by the command of God and of Christ;
nor their priests called, as Aaron's priesthood was;
nor their tithes appointed by God, as those amongst
the Jews were; but that Christ was come, who ended
both the temple and its worship, and the priests and
their tithes; and that all should now hearken unto
Him; for He said, "Learn of me"; and God said of
Him, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased; hear ye Him."</p>

<p>I declared unto them that the Lord God had sent
me to preach the everlasting gospel and Word of life
amongst them, and to bring them off from all these
temples, tithes, priests, and rudiments of the world,
which had been instituted since the apostles' days,
and had been set up by such as had erred from the
Spirit and power the apostles were in. Very largely
was I opened at this meeting, and the Lord's convincing
power accompanied my ministry, and reached the
hearts of the people, whereby many were convinced;
and all the teachers of that congregation (who were
many) were convinced of God's everlasting truth.</p>

<p>At Kendal a meeting was held in the Town-hall.
Several were convinced and many were loving. One
whose name was Cock met me in the street and would
have given me a roll of tobacco, for people were then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
much given to smoking. I accepted his love, but did
not receive his tobacco.</p>

<p>Thence I went to Underbarrow, and several people
going along with me, great reasonings I had with
them, especially with Edward Burrough.<a name="FNanchor_54_73" id="FNanchor_54_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_73" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>At night the priest and many professors came to
the house; and a great deal of disputing I had with
them. Supper being provided for the priest and the
rest of the company, I had not freedom to eat with
them; but told them that if they would appoint a
meeting for the next day at the steeple-house, and
acquaint the people with it, I might meet them.
They had a great deal of reasoning about it; some
being for, and some against it.</p>

<p>In the morning, after I had spoken to them again
concerning the meeting, as I walked upon a bank by
the house, there came several poor travellers, asking
relief, who I saw were in necessity; and they gave
them nothing, but said they were cheats. It grieved
me to see such hard-heartedness amongst professors;
whereupon, when they were gone in to their breakfast,
I ran after the poor people about a quarter of a
mile, and gave them some money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile some that were in the house, coming
out, and seeing me a quarter of a mile off, said I
could not have gone so far in such an instant, if I
had not had wings. Hereupon the meeting was like
to have been put by; for they were filled with such
strange thoughts concerning me that many of them
were against having a meeting with me.<a name="FNanchor_T_74" id="FNanchor_T_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_74" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>I told them that I had run after those poor people
to give them some money; being grieved at the hard-heartedness
of those who gave them nothing.</p>

<p>Then came Miles and Stephen Hubbersty, who,
being more simple-hearted men, would have the
meeting held. So to the chapel I went, and the
priest came.</p>

<p>A great meeting there was, and the way of life and
salvation was opened; and after awhile the priest fled
away. Many of Crook and Underbarrow were convinced
that day, received the Word of life, and stood
fast in it under the teaching of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>After I had declared the truth to them for some
hours, and the meeting was ended, the chief constable
and some other professors fell to reasoning with
me in the chapel yard. Whereupon I took a Bible
and opened the Scriptures, and dealt tenderly with
them, as one would do with a child. They that were
in the Light of Christ and Spirit of God knew when
I spake Scripture, though I did not mention chapter
and verse, after the priest's form, to them.</p>

<p>Then I went to an ale-house, to which many resorted
betwixt the time of their morning and afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
preaching, and had a great deal of reasoning
with the people, declaring to them that God was
come to teach His people, and to bring them off from
the false teachers, such as the prophets, Christ, and
the apostles cried against. Many received the Word
of life at that time, and abode in it.</p>

<p>Thence I went to Ulverstone, and so to Swarthmore<a name="FNanchor_U_75" id="FNanchor_U_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_75" class="fnanchor">[U]</a>
to Judge Fell's; whither came up one Lampitt,
a priest, who was a high notionist. With him
I had much reasoning; for he talked of high notions
and perfection, and thereby deceived the people. He
would have owned me, but I could not own nor join
with him, he was so full of filth.<a name="FNanchor_55_76" id="FNanchor_55_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_76" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He said he was
above John; and made as though he knew all things.
But I told him that death reigned from Adam to
Moses; that he was under death, and knew not
Moses, for Moses saw the paradise of God; but he
knew neither Moses nor the prophets nor John; for
that crooked and rough nature stood in him, and the
mountain of sin and corruption; and the way was not
prepared in him for the Lord.</p>

<p>He confessed he had been under a cross in things;
but now he could sing psalms, and do anything. I
told him that now he could see a thief, and join hand
in hand with him; but he could not preach Moses, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the prophets, nor John, nor Christ, except he were in
the same Spirit that they were in.</p>

<p>Margaret Fell had been absent in the day-time;
and at night her children told her that priest Lampitt
and I had disagreed, which somewhat troubled her,
because she was in profession with him; but he hid
his dirty actions from them. At night we had much
reasoning, and I declared the truth to her and her
family. The next day Lampitt came again, and I
had much discourse with him before Margaret Fell,
who then clearly discerned the priest. A convincement
of the Lord's truth came upon her and her
family.</p>

<p>Soon after a day was to be observed for a humiliation,
and Margaret Fell asked me to go with her to
the steeple-house at Ulverstone, for she was not
wholly come off from them. I replied, "I must do
as I am ordered by the Lord." So I left her, and
walked into the fields; and the Word of the Lord
came to me, saying, "Go to the steeple-house after
them."</p>

<p>When I came, Lampitt was singing with his people;
but his spirit was so foul, and the matter they
sung so unsuitable to their states, that after they had
done singing, I was moved of the Lord to speak to
him and the people. The word of the Lord to them
was, "He is not a Jew that is one outwardly, but he
is a Jew that is one inwardly, whose praise is not of
man, but of God."</p>

<p>As the Lord opened further, I showed them that
God was come to teach His people by His Spirit, and
to bring them off from all their old ways, religions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
churches, and worships; for all their religions, worships,
and ways were but talking with other men's
words; but they were out of the life and Spirit which
they were in who gave them forth.</p>

<p>Then cried out one, called Justice Sawrey, "Take
him away"; but Judge Fell's wife said to the officers,
"Let him alone; why may not he speak as well as
any other?"<a name="FNanchor_56_77" id="FNanchor_56_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_77" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Lampitt also, the priest, in deceit
said, "Let him speak." So at length, when I had
declared some time, Justice Sawrey caused the constable
to put me out; and then I spoke to the people
in the graveyard.</p>

<p>From thence I went into the island of Walney;
and after the priest had done I spoke to him, but he
got away. Then I declared the truth to the people,
but they were something rude. I went to speak with
the priest at his house, but he would not be seen.
The people said he went to hide himself in the hay-mow;
and they looked for him there, but could not
find him. Then they said he was gone to hide himself
in the standing corn, but they could not find him
there either. I went to James Lancaster's, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
island, who was convinced, and from thence returned
to Swarthmore, where the Lord's power seized upon
Margaret Fell, her daughter Sarah, and several
others.</p>

<p>Then I went to Baycliff, where Leonard Fell was
convinced, and became a minister of the everlasting
gospel. Several others were convinced there, and
came into obedience to the truth. Here the people
said they could not dispute; and would fain have put
some other to hold talk with me; but I bade them
fear the Lord, and not in a light way hold a talk of
the Lord's words, but put the things in practice.<a name="FNanchor_57_78" id="FNanchor_57_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_78" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>I directed them to the Divine Light of Christ, and
His Spirit in their hearts, which would let them see
all the evil thoughts, words, and actions that they
had thought, spoken, and acted; by which Light they
might see their sin, and also their Saviour Christ
Jesus to save them from their sins. This I told them
was their first step to peace, even to stand still in the
Light that showed them their sins and transgressions;
by which they might come to see they were in
the fall of old Adam, in darkness and death, strangers
to the covenant of promise, and without God in
the world; and by the same Light they might see
Christ that died for them to be their Redeemer and
Saviour, and their way to God.</p>

<p>Soon after, Judge Fell being come home, Margaret
Fell, his wife, sent to me, desiring me to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
thither; and feeling freedom from the Lord
so to do, I went back to Swarthmore. I
found the priests and professors, and that envious
Justice Sawrey, had much incensed Judge
Fell and Captain Sands against the truth by
their lies; but when I came to speak with him
I answered all his objections, and so thoroughly
satisfied him by the Scriptures that he was convinced
in his judgment. He asked me if I was that George
Fox of whom Justice Robinson spoke so much in
commendation amongst many of the Parliament
men? I told him I had been with Justice Robinson,
and with Justice Hotham in Yorkshire, who were
very civil and loving to me; and that they were convinced
in their judgment by the Spirit of God that
the principle to which I bore testimony was the
truth; and they saw over and beyond the priests of
the nation, so that they, and many others, were now
come to be wiser than their teachers.</p>

<p>After we had discoursed some time together,
Judge Fell himself was satisfied also, and came to see,
by the openings of the Spirit of God in his heart,
over all the priests and teachers of the world, and did
not go to hear them for some years before he died;
for he knew it was the truth that I declared, and that
Christ was the teacher of His people, and their
Saviour. He sometimes wished that I were a while
with Judge Bradshaw to discourse with him.</p>

<p>There came to Judge Fell's Captain Sands before-mentioned,
endeavouring to incense the Judge
against me, for he was an evil-minded man, and full
of envy against me; and yet he could speak high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
things, and use the Scripture words, and say, "Behold,
I make all things new." But I told him, then
he must have a new God, for his God was his belly.
Besides him came also that envious justice, John Sawrey.
I told him his heart was rotten, and he was full
of hypocrisy to the brim. Several other people also
came, of whose states the Lord gave me a discerning;
and I spoke to their conditions.<a name="FNanchor_V_79" id="FNanchor_V_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_79" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> While I was in
those parts, Richard Farnsworth and James Nayler
came to see me and the family; and Judge Fell, being
satisfied that it was the way of truth, notwithstanding
all their opposition, suffered the meeting to be
kept at his house. A great meeting was settled there
in the Lord's power, which continued near forty
years, until the year 1690, when a new meeting-house
was erected near it.<a name="FNanchor_58_80" id="FNanchor_58_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_80" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>On the market-day I went to Lancaster, and spoke
through the market in the dreadful power of God,
declaring the day of the Lord to the people, and crying
out against all their deceitful merchandise. I
preached righteousness and truth unto them, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
all should follow after, walk and live in, directing
them how and where they might find and receive the
Spirit of God to guide them thereinto.</p>

<p>After I had cleared myself in the market, I went
to my lodging, whither several people came; and
many were convinced who have since stood faithful
to the truth.</p>

<p>The First-day following, in the forenoon, I had a
great meeting in the street at Lancaster, amongst the
soldiers and people, to whom I declared the Word of
life, and the everlasting truth. I opened unto them
that all the traditions they had lived in, all their worships
and religions, and the profession they made of
the Scriptures, were good for nothing while they
lived out of the life and power which those were in
who gave forth the Scriptures. I directed them to
the Light of Christ, the heavenly man, and to the
Spirit of God in their own hearts, that they might
come to be acquainted with God and Christ, receive
Him for their teacher, and know His kingdom set up
in them.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went to the steeple-house at
Lancaster, and declared the truth to the priest and
people, laying open before them the deceit they lived
in, and directing them to the power and Spirit of God
which they wanted. But they haled me out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
stoned me along the street till I came to John Lawson's
house.</p>

<p>Another First-day I went to a steeple-house by the
water-side, where one Whitehead was priest. To him
and to the people I declared the truth in the dreadful
power of God. There came a doctor so full of
envy that he said he could find it in his heart to run
me through with his rapier, though he were hanged
for it the next day; yet this man came afterwards to
be convinced of the truth so far as to be loving to
Friends. Some were convinced thereabouts who
willingly sat down under the ministry of Christ,
their teacher; and a meeting was settled there in the
power of God, which has continued to this day.</p>

<p>After this I returned into Westmoreland, and
spoke through Kendal on a market-day. So dreadful
was the power of God upon me, that people flew like
chaff before me into their houses. I warned them of
the mighty day of the Lord, and exhorted them to
hearken to the voice of God in their own hearts, who
was now come to teach His people Himself. When
some opposed, many others took my part. At last
some fell to fighting about me; but I went and spoke
to them, and they parted again. Several were convinced.</p>

<p>After I had travelled up and down in those countries,
and had had great meetings, I came to Swarthmore
again. And when I had visited Friends in
those parts, I heard of a great meeting the priests
were to have at Ulverstone, on a lecture-day. I went
to it, and into the steeple-house in the dread and
power of the Lord. When the priest had done, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
spoke among them the Word of the Lord, which was
as a hammer, and as a fire amongst them. And though
Lampitt, the priest of the place, had been at variance
with most of the priests before, yet against the truth
they all joined together. But the mighty power of
the Lord was over all; and so wonderful was the
appearance thereof, that priest Bennett said the
church shook, insomuch that he was afraid and trembled.
And when he had spoken a few confused
words he hastened out for fear it should fall on his
head. Many priests got together there; but they had
no power as yet to persecute.</p>

<p>When I had cleared my conscience towards them,
I went up to Swarthmore again, whither came four
or five of the priests. Coming to discourse, I asked
them whether any one of them could say he had ever
had the word of the Lord to go and speak to such or
such a people. None of them durst say he had; but
one of them burst out into a passion and said that he
could speak his experiences as well as I.</p>

<p>I told him experience was one thing; but to receive
and go with a message, and to have a Word from the
Lord, as the prophets and apostles had had and done,
and as I had done to them, this was another thing.
And therefore I put it to them again, "Can any of
you say you have ever had a command or word from
the Lord immediately at any time?" but none of
them could say so.</p>

<p>Then I told them that the false prophets, the false
apostles, and the antichrists, could use the words of
the true prophets, the true apostles, and of Christ,
and would speak of other men's experiences, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
they themselves never knew or heard the voice of
God or Christ; and that such as they might obtain
the good words and experiences of others. This puzzled
them much, and laid them open.</p>

<p>At another time, when I was discoursing with
several priests at Judge Fell's house, and he was by,
I asked them the same question,&mdash;whether any of
them had ever heard the voice of God or Christ, to
bid him go to such and such a people, to declare His
word or message unto them. Any one, I told them,
that could but read, might declare the experiences of
the prophets and apostles, which were recorded in the
Scriptures. Thereupon Thomas Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_59_81" id="FNanchor_59_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_81" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> an ancient
priest, did ingenuously confess before Judge Fell
that he had never heard the voice of God, nor of
Christ, to send him to any people; but that he spoke
his experiences, and the experiences of the saints in
former ages, and that he preached. This very much
confirmed Judge Fell in the persuasion he had that
the priests were wrong; for he had thought formerly,
as the generality of people then did, that they were
sent from God.</p>

<p>Now began the priests to rage more and more, and
as much as they could to stir up persecution. James
Nayler and Francis Howgill were cast into prison in
Appleby jail, at the instigation of the malicious
priests, some of whom prophesied that within a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
month we should be all scattered again, and come to
nothing. But, blessed for ever be the worthy name
of the Lord, His work went on and prospered; for
about this time John Audland, Francis Howgill,
John Camm, Edward Burrough, Richard Hubberthorn,
Miles Hubbersty, and Miles Halhead, with
several others, being endued with power from on
high, came forth in the work of the ministry, and
approved themselves faithful labourers therein, travelling
up and down, and preaching the gospel freely;
by means whereof multitudes were convinced, and
many effectually turned to the Lord.</p>

<p>On a lecture-day I was moved to go to the steeple-house
at Ulverstone, where were abundance of professors,
priests, and people. I went near to priest
Lampitt, who was blustering on in his preaching.
After the Lord had opened my mouth to speak, John
Sawrey, the justice, came to me and said that if I
would speak according to the Scriptures, I should
speak. I admired him for speaking so to me, and
told him I would speak according to the Scriptures,
and bring the Scriptures to prove what I had to say;
for I had something to speak to Lampitt and to them.
Then he said I should not speak, contradicting himself,
for he had said just before that I should speak if
I would speak according to the Scriptures. The people
were quiet, and heard me gladly, till this Justice
Sawrey (who was the first stirrer-up of cruel persecution
in the north) incensed them against me, and
set them on to hale, beat, and bruise me. But now
on a sudden the people were in a rage, and fell upon
me in the steeple-house before his face, knocked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
down, kicked me, and trampled upon me. So great
was the uproar, that some tumbled over their seats
for fear.</p>

<p>At last he came and took me from the people, led
me out of the steeple-house, and put me into the
hands of the constables and other officers, bidding
them whip me, and put me out of the town. They
led me about a quarter of a mile, some taking hold
by my collar, some by my arms and shoulders; and
they shook and dragged me along.</p>

<p>Many friendly people being come to the market,
and some to the steeple-house to hear me, divers of
these they knocked down also, and broke their heads,
so that the blood ran down from several; and Judge
Fell's son running after to see what they would do
with me, they threw him into a ditch of water, some
of them crying, "Knock the teeth out of his head."</p>

<p>When they had haled me to the common moss-side,
a multitude following, the constables and other
officers gave me some blows over my back with their
willow rods, and thrust me among the rude multitude,
who, having furnished themselves with staves,
hedge-stakes, holm or holly bushes, fell upon me,
and beat me on my head, arms, and shoulders, till
they had deprived me of sense; so that I fell down
upon the wet common.</p>

<p>When I recovered again, and saw myself lying in
a watery common, and the people standing about me,
I lay still a little while, and the power of the Lord
sprang through me, and the eternal refreshings
revived me; so that I stood up again in the strengthening
power of the eternal God, and stretching out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
my arms toward them, I said, with a loud voice,
"Strike again; here are my arms, my head, and my
cheeks."</p>

<p>There was in the company a mason, a professor,
but a rude fellow, who with his walking rule-staff
gave me a blow with all his might just over the back
of my hand, as it was stretched out; with which blow
my hand was so bruised, and my arm so benumbed,
that I could not draw it to me again. Some of the
people cried, "He hath spoiled his hand for ever
having the use of it any more." But I looked at it in
the love of God (for I was in the love of God to all
that persecuted me), and after awhile the Lord's
power sprang through me again, and through my
hand and arm, so that in a moment I recovered
strength in my hand and arm in the sight of them
all.</p>

<p>Then they began to fall out among themselves.
Some of them came to me, and said that if I would
give them money they would secure me from the
rest. But I was moved of the Lord to declare the
Word of life, and showed them their false Christianity,
and the fruits of their priest's ministry, telling
them that they were more like heathens and
Jews than true Christians.</p>

<p>Then was I moved of the Lord to come up again
through the midst of the people, and go into Ulverstone
market. As I went, there met me a soldier,
with his sword by his side. "Sir," said he to me, "I
see you are a man, and I am ashamed and grieved
that you should be thus abused"; and he offered to
assist me in what he could. I told him that the Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
power was over all; and I walked through the people
in the market, none of whom had power to touch me
then. But some of the market people abusing some
Friends in the market, I turned about, and saw this
soldier among them with his naked rapier; whereupon
I ran, and, catching hold of the hand his rapier
was in, bid him put up his sword again if he would
go along with me.</p>

<p>About two weeks after this I went into Walney
island, and James Nayler went with me. We stayed
one night at a little town on this side, called Cockan,
and had a meeting there, where one was convinced.</p>

<p>After a while there came a man with a pistol,
whereupon the people ran out of doors. He called for
me; and when I came out to him he snapped his pistol
at me, but it would not go off. This caused the people
to make a great bustle about him; and some of them
took hold of him, to prevent his doing mischief. But
I was moved in the Lord's power to speak to him; and
he was so struck by the power of the Lord that he
trembled for fear, and went and hid himself. Thus
the Lord's power came over them all, though there
was a great rage in the country.</p>

<p>Next morning I went over in a boat to James Lancaster's.
As soon as I came to land there rushed out
about forty men with staves, clubs, and fishing-poles,
who fell upon me, beating and punching me, and
endeavouring to thrust me backward into the sea.
When they had thrust me almost into the sea, and I
saw they would knock me down in it, I went up into
the midst of them; but they laid at me again, and
knocked me down, and stunned me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>When I came to myself, I looked up and saw
James Lancaster's wife throwing stones at my face,
and her husband, James Lancaster, was lying over
me, to keep the blows and the stones off me. For the
people had persuaded James Lancaster's wife that I
had bewitched her husband, and had promised her
that if she would let them know when I came thither
they would be my death. And having got knowledge
of my coming, many of the town rose up in this manner
with clubs and staves to kill me; but the Lord's
power preserved me, that they could not take away
my life.</p>

<p>At length I got up on my feet, but they beat me
down again into the boat; which James Lancaster
observing, he presently came into it, and set me over
the water from them; but while we were on the
water within their reach they struck at us with long
poles, and threw stones after us. By the time we
were come to the other side, we saw them beating
James Nayler; for whilst they had been beating me,
he walked up into a field, and they never minded him
till I was gone; then they fell upon him, and all their
cry was, "Kill him, kill him."</p>

<p>When I was come over to the town again, on the
other side of the water, the townsmen rose up with
pitchforks, flails, and staves, to keep me out of the
town, crying, "Kill him, knock him on the head,
bring the cart, and carry him away to the churchyard."
So after they had abused me, they drove me
some distance out of the town, and there left me.</p>

<p>Then James Lancaster went back to look after
James Nayler; and I being now left alone, went to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ditch of water, and having washed myself (for they
had besmeared my face, hands, and clothes with miry
dirt), I walked about three miles to Thomas Hutton's
house, where lodged Thomas Lawson, the priest that
was convinced.</p>

<p>When I came in I could hardly speak to them, I
was so bruised; only I told them where I left James
Nayler. So they took each of them a horse, and went
and brought him thither that night. The next day
Margaret Fell hearing of it, sent a horse for me; but
I was so sore with bruises, I was not able to bear the
shaking of the horse without much pain.</p>

<p>When I was come to Swarthmore, Justice Sawrey
and one Justice Thompson, of Lancaster, granted a
warrant against me; but Judge Fell coming home, it
was not served upon me; for he was out of the country
all this time that I was thus cruelly abused.
When he came home he sent forth warrants into the
isle of Walney, to apprehend all those riotous persons;
whereupon some of them fled the country.</p>

<p>James Lancaster's wife was afterwards convinced
of the truth, and repented of the evils she had done
me; and so did others of those bitter persecutors
also; but the judgments of God fell upon some of
them, and destruction is come upon many of them
since. Judge Fell asked me to give him a relation of
my persecution; but I told him they could do no
otherwise in the spirit wherein they were, and that
they manifested the fruits of their priest's ministry,
and their profession and religion to be wrong. So
he told his wife I made light of it, and that I spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of it as a man that had not been concerned; for,
indeed, the Lord's power healed me again.</p>

<p>The time for the sessions at Lancaster being come,
I went thither with Judge Fell, who on the way told
me he had never had such a matter brought before
him before, and he could not well tell what to do in
the business. I told him, when Paul was brought
before the rulers, and the Jews and priests came
down to accuse him, and laid many false things to
his charge, Paul stood still all that while. And when
they had done, Festus, the governor, and king
Agrippa, beckoned to him to speak for himself;
which Paul did, and cleared himself of all those false
accusations; so he might do with me.</p>

<p>Being come to Lancaster, Justice Sawrey and Justice
Thompson having granted a warrant to apprehend
me, though I was not apprehended by it, yet
hearing of it, I appeared at the sessions, where there
appeared against me about forty priests. These had
chosen one Marshall, priest of Lancaster, to be their
orator; and had provided one young priest, and two
priests' sons, to bear witness against me, who had
sworn beforehand that I had spoken blasphemy.</p>

<p>When the justices were sat, they heard all that the
priests and their witnesses could say and charge
against me, their orator Marshall sitting by, and explaining
their sayings for them. But the witnesses
were so confounded that they discovered themselves
to be false witnesses; for when the court had examined
one of them upon oath, and then began to examine
another, he was at such loss he could not answer
directly, but said the other could say it. Which made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the justices say to him, "Have you sworn it, and
given it in already upon your oath, and now say that
he can say it? It seems you did not hear those words
spoken yourself, though you have sworn it."</p>

<p>There were then in court several who had been at
that meeting, wherein the witnesses swore I spoke
those blasphemous words which the priests accused
me of; and these, being men of integrity and reputation
in the country, did declare and affirm in court
that the oath which the witnesses had taken against
me was altogether false; and that no such words as
they had sworn against me were spoken by me at that
meeting. Indeed, most of the serious men of that
side of the country, then at the sessions, had been at
that meeting; and had heard me both at that and at
other meetings also.</p>

<p>This was taken notice of by Colonel West, who,
being a justice of the peace, was then upon the
bench; and having long been weak in body, blessed
the Lord and said that He had healed him that day;
adding that he never saw so many sober people and
good faces together in all his life. Then, turning himself
to me, he said in the open sessions, "George, if
thou hast anything to say to the people, thou mayest
freely declare it."</p>

<p>I was moved of the Lord to speak; and as soon as I
began, priest Marshall, the orator for the rest of the
priests, went his way. That which I was moved to
declare was this: that the holy Scriptures were given
forth by the Spirit of God; and that all people must
come to the Spirit of God in themselves in order to
know God and Christ, of whom the prophets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
apostles learnt: and that by the same Spirit all men
might know the holy Scriptures. For as the Spirit
of God was in them that gave forth the Scriptures,
so the same Spirit must be in all them that come to
understand the Scriptures. By this Spirit they might
have fellowship with the Father, with the Son, with
the Scriptures, and with one another: and without
this Spirit they can know neither God, Christ, nor
the Scriptures, nor have a right fellowship one with
another.</p>

<p>I had no sooner spoken these words than about
half a dozen priests, that stood behind me, burst into
a passion. One of them, whose name was Jackus,
amongst other things that he spake against the
Truth, said that the Spirit and the letter were inseparable.
I replied, "Then every one that hath the
letter hath the Spirit; and they might buy the Spirit
with the letter of the Scriptures."</p>

<p>This plain discovery of darkness in the priest
moved Judge Fell and Colonel West to reprove them
openly, and tell them that according to that position
they might carry the Spirit in their pockets as they
did the Scriptures. Upon this the priests, being confounded
and put to silence, rushed out in a rage
against the justices, because they could not have their
bloody ends upon me. The justices, seeing the witnesses
did not agree, and perceiving that they were
brought to answer the priests' envy, and finding that
all their evidences were not sufficient in law to make
good their charge against me, discharged me.</p>

<p>After Judge Fell had spoken to Justice Sawrey
and Justice Thompson concerning the warrant they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
had given forth against me, and showing them the
errors thereof, he and Colonel West granted a supersedeas<a name="FNanchor_W_82" id="FNanchor_W_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_82" class="fnanchor">[W]</a>
to stop the execution of it. Thus I was
cleared in open sessions of those lying accusations
which the malicious priests had laid to my charge:
and multitudes of people praised God that day, for
it was a joyful day to many. Justice Benson, of
Westmoreland, was convinced; and Major Ripan,
mayor of the town of Lancaster, also.</p>

<p>It was a day of everlasting salvation to hundreds
of people: for the Lord Jesus Christ, the way to the
Father, the free Teacher, was exalted and set up; His
everlasting gospel was preached, and the Word of
eternal life was declared over the heads of the
priests, and all such lucrative preachers. For the
Lord opened many mouths that day to speak His
Word to the priests, and several friendly people and
professors reproved them in their inns, and in the
streets, so that they fell, like an old rotten house: and
the cry was among the people that the Quakers had
got the day, and the priests were fallen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish">In Prison Again</p>

<h3>1653.</h3>


<p>About the beginning of the year 1653 I returned
to Swarthmore, and going to a meeting at Gleaston,
a professor challenged to dispute with me. I went to
the house where he was, and called him to come
forth; but the Lord's power was over him, so that
he durst not meddle.</p>

<p>I departed thence, visited the meetings of Friends
in Lancashire, and came back to Swarthmore. Great
openings I had from the Lord, not only of divine and
spiritual matters, but also of outward things relating
to the civil government.</p>

<p>Being one day in Swarthmore Hall, when Judge
Fell and Justice Benson were talking of the news,
and of the Parliament then sitting (called the Long
Parliament), I was moved to tell them that before
that day two weeks the Parliament should be broken
up, and the Speaker plucked out of his chair. That
day two weeks Justice Benson told Judge Fell that
now he saw George was a true prophet; for Oliver
had broken up the Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_60_83" id="FNanchor_60_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_83" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>About this time I was in a fast for about ten days,
my spirit being greatly exercised on Truth's behalf:
for James Milner and Richard Myer went out into
imaginations, and a company followed them. This
James Milner and some of his company had true
openings at the first; but getting up into pride and
exaltation of spirit, they ran out from Truth. I was
sent for to them, and was moved of the Lord to go
and show them their outgoings. They were brought
to see their folly, and condemned it; and came into
the way of Truth again.</p>

<p>After some time I went to a meeting at Arnside,
where was Richard Myer, who had been long lame
of one of his arms. I was moved of the Lord to say
unto him amongst all the people, "Stand up upon
thy legs," for he was sitting down. And he stood up,
and stretched out his arm that had been lame a long
time, and said, "Be it known unto you, all people,
that this day I am healed."<a name="FNanchor_61_84" id="FNanchor_61_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_84" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Yet his parents could
hardly believe it; but after the meeting was done,
they had him aside, took off his doublet, and then
saw it was true.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>He came soon after to Swarthmore meeting, and
there declared how the Lord had healed him. Yet
after this the Lord commanded him to go to York
with a message from Him, which he disobeyed; and
the Lord struck him again, so that he died about
three-quarters of a year after.</p>

<p>Now were great threatenings given forth in Cumberland
that if ever I came there they would take
away my life. When I heard it I was drawn to go
into Cumberland; and went to Miles Wennington's,
in the same parish from which those threatenings
came: but they had not power to touch me.</p>

<p>On a First-day I went into the steeple-house at
Bootle;<a name="FNanchor_X_85" id="FNanchor_X_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_85" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> and when the priest had done, I began to
speak. But the people were exceeding rude, and
struck and beat me in the yard; one gave me a very
great blow over my wrist, so that the people thought
he had broken my hand to pieces. The constable was
very desirous to keep the peace, and would have set
some of them that struck me by the heels, if I would
have given way to it. After my service amongst
them was over, I went to Joseph Nicholson's house,
and the constable went a little way with us, to keep
off the rude multitude.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went again. The priest had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to help him another priest, that came from London,
and was highly accounted of. Before I went into
the steeple-house, I sat a little upon the cross, and
Friends with me; but the Friends were moved to go
into the steeple-house, and I went in after them.</p>

<p>The London priest was preaching. He gathered
up all the Scriptures he could think of that spoke of
false prophets, and antichrists, and deceivers, and
threw them upon us; but when he had done I recollected
all those Scriptures, and brought them back
upon himself. Then the people fell upon me in a
rude manner; but the constable charged them to
keep the peace, and so made them quiet again. Then
the priest began to rage, and said I must not speak
there. I told him he had his hour-glass, by which he
had preached; and he having done, the time was free
for me, as well as for him, for he was but a stranger
there himself.<a name="FNanchor_62_86" id="FNanchor_62_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_86" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>So I opened the Scriptures to them, and let them
see that those Scriptures that spoke of the false
prophets, and antichrists, and deceivers, described
them and their generation; and belonged to them
who were found walking in their steps, and bringing
forth their fruits; and not unto us, who were not
guilty of such things. I manifested to them that they
were out of the steps of the true prophets and apostles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and showed them clearly, by the fruits and
marks, that it was they of whom those Scriptures
spoke, and not we. And I declared the Truth, and
the Word of life to the people; and directed them to
Christ their teacher.</p>

<p>When I came down again to Joseph Nicholson's
house, I saw a great hole in my coat, which was cut
with a knife; but it was not cut through my doublet,
for the Lord had prevented their mischief. The next
day there was a rude, wicked man who would have
done violence to a Friend, but the Lord's power
stopped him.</p>

<p>Now was I moved to send James Lancaster to
appoint a meeting at the steeple-house of John Wilkinson,
near Cockermouth,&mdash;a preacher in great
repute, who had three parishes under him. I stayed
at Milholm, in Bootle, till James Lancaster came
back again. In the meantime some of the gentry of
the country had formed a plot against me, and had
given a little boy a rapier, with which to do me mischief.
They came with the boy to Joseph Nicholson's
to seek me; but the Lord had so ordered it that
I was gone into the fields. They met with James
Lancaster, but did not much abuse him; and not finding
me in the house, they went away again. So I
walked up and down in the fields that night, as very
often I used to do, and did not go to bed.</p>

<p>We came the next day to the steeple-house where
James Lancaster had appointed the meeting. There
were at this meeting twelve soldiers and their wives,
from Carlisle; and the country people came in, as if
it were to a fair. I lay at a house somewhat short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the place, so that many Friends got thither before
me. When I came I found James Lancaster speaking
under a yew tree which was so full of people that
I feared they would break it down.</p>

<p>I looked about for a place to stand upon, to speak
unto the people, for they lay all up and down, like
people at a leaguer.<a name="FNanchor_Y_87" id="FNanchor_Y_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_87" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> After I was discovered, a professor
asked if I would not go into the church? I,
seeing no place abroad convenient to speak to the
people from, told him, Yes; whereupon the people
rushed in, so that when I came the house and pulpit
were so full I had much ado to get in. Those that
could not get in stood abroad about the walls.</p>

<p>When the people were settled I stood up on a seat,
and the Lord opened my mouth to declare His everlasting
Truth and His everlasting day. When I had
largely declared the Word of life unto them for
about the space of three hours, I walked forth
amongst the people, who passed away well satisfied.
Among the rest a professor followed me, praising
and commending me; but his words were like a thistle
to me. Many hundreds were convinced that day,
and received the Lord Jesus Christ and His free
teaching, with gladness; of whom some have died in
the Truth, and many stand faithful witnesses thereof.
The soldiers also were convinced, and their wives.</p>

<p>After this I went to a village, and many people
accompanied me. As I was sitting in a house full of
people, declaring the Word of life unto them, I cast
mine eye upon a woman, and discerned an unclean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
spirit in her. And I was moved of the Lord to speak
sharply to her, and told her she was under the influence
of an unclean spirit;<a name="FNanchor_63_88" id="FNanchor_63_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_88" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> whereupon she went out
of the room. Now, I being a stranger there, and
knowing nothing of the woman outwardly, the people
wondered at it, and told me afterwards that I had
discovered a great thing; for all the country looked
upon her to be a wicked person.</p>

<p>The Lord had given me a spirit of discerning, by
which I many times saw the states and conditions of
people, and could try their spirits. For not long
before, as I was going to a meeting, I saw some
women in a field, and I discerned an evil spirit in
them; and I was moved to go out of my way into the
field to them, and declare unto them their conditions.
At another time there came one into Swarthmore
Hall in the meeting time, and I was moved to speak
sharply to her, and told her she was under the power
of an evil spirit; and the people said afterwards she
was generally accounted so. There came also at
another time another woman, and stood at a distance
from me, and I cast mine eye upon her, and said,
"Thou hast been an harlot"; for I perfectly saw the
condition and life of the woman. The woman
answered and said that many could tell her of her
outward sins, but none could tell her of her inward.
Then I told her her heart was not right before the
Lord, and that from the inward came the outward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
This woman came afterwards to be convinced of
God's truth, and became a Friend.</p>

<p>Thence we travelled to Carlisle. The pastor of
the Baptists, with most of his hearers, came to the
abbey, where I had a meeting; and I declared the
Word of life amongst them. Many of the Baptists
and of the soldiers were convinced. After the meeting
the pastor of the Baptists, an high notionist and a
flashy man, asked me what must be damned. I was
moved immediately to tell him that that which spoke
in him was to be damned. This stopped his mouth;
and the witness of God was raised up in him. I
opened to him the states of election and reprobation;
so that he said he never heard the like in his life. He
came afterwards to be convinced.</p>

<p>Then I went to the castle among the soldiers, who
beat a drum and called the garrison together. I
preached the Truth amongst them, directing them
to the Lord Jesus Christ to be their teacher, and to
the measure of His Spirit in themselves, by which
they might be turned from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan unto God. I warned them
all that they should do no violence to any man, but
should show forth a Christian life: telling them that
He who was to be their Teacher would be their condemner
if they were disobedient to Him. So I left
them, having no opposition from any of them, except
the sergeants, who afterwards came to be convinced.</p>

<p>On the market-day I went up into the market, to
the market-cross. The magistrates had both threatened,
and sent their sergeants; and the magistrates'
wives had said that if I came there they would pluck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the hair off my head; and the sergeants should take
me up. Nevertheless I obeyed the Lord God, went
up on the cross, and declared unto them that the day
of the Lord was coming upon all their deceitful ways
and doings, and deceitful merchandise; that they
should put away all cozening and cheating, and keep
to Yea and Nay, and speak the truth one to another.
So the Truth and the power of God was set over
them.</p>

<p>After I had declared the Word of life to the people,
the throng being so great that the sergeants
could not reach me, nor the magistrates' wives come
at me, I passed away quietly. Many people and soldiers
came to me, and some Baptists, that were bitter
contenders; amongst whom one of their deacons, an
envious man, finding that the Lord's power was over
them, cried out for very anger. Whereupon I set my
eyes upon him, and spoke sharply to him in the power
of the Lord: and he cried, "Do not pierce me so with
thy eyes; keep thy eyes off me."<a name="FNanchor_64_89" id="FNanchor_64_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_89" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The First-day following I went into the steeple-house:
and after the priest had done, I preached the
Truth to the people, and declared the Word of life
amongst them. The priest got away; and the magistrates
desired me to go out of the steeple-house. But
I still declared the way of the Lord unto them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
told them I came to speak the Word of life and salvation
from the Lord amongst them. The power of the
Lord was dreadful amongst them, so that the people
trembled and shook, and they thought the steeple-house
shook; some of them feared it would have
fallen down on their heads. The magistrates' wives
were in a rage, and strove mightily to get at me: but
the soldiers and friendly people stood thick about me.</p>

<p>At length the rude people of the city rose, and
came with staves and stones into the steeple-house,
crying, "Down with these round-headed rogues";
and they threw stones. Whereupon the governor
sent a file or two of musketeers into the steeple-house
to appease the tumult, and commanded all the other
soldiers out. So those soldiers took me by the hand
in a friendly manner, and said they would have me
along with them.</p>

<p>When we came into the street the city was in an
uproar. The governor came down; and some of the
soldiers were put in prison for standing by me against
the townspeople.</p>

<p>A lieutenant, who had been convinced, came and
brought me to his house, where there was a Baptist
meeting, and thither came Friends also. We had a
very quiet meeting; they heard the Word of life
gladly, and many received it.</p>

<p>The next day, the justices and magistrates of the
town being gathered together in the town-hall, they
granted a warrant against me, and sent for me before
them. I was then gone to a Baptist's; but hearing of
it, I went up to the hall, where many rude people
were, some of whom had sworn false things against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
me. I had a great deal of discourse with the magistrates,
wherein I laid open the fruits of their priests'
preaching, showed them how they were void of
Christianity, and that, though they were such great
professors (for they were Independents and Presbyterians)
they were without the possession of that
which they professed. After a large examination,
they committed me to prison as a blasphemer, a heretic,
and a seducer,<a name="FNanchor_65_90" id="FNanchor_65_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_90" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> though they could not justly
charge any such thing against me.</p>

<p>The jail at Carlisle had two jailers, an upper and
an under, who looked like two great bear-wards.
When I was brought in the upper jailer took me up
into a great chamber, and told me I should have what
I would in that room. But I told him he should not
expect any money from me, for I would neither lie in
any of his beds, nor eat any of his victuals. Then he
put me into another room, where after awhile I got
something to lie upon.</p>

<p>There I lay till the assizes came, and then all the
talk was that I was to be hanged. The high sheriff,
Wilfred Lawson, stirred them much up to take away
my life, and said he would guard me to my execution
himself. They were in a rage, and set three musketeers
for guard upon me, one at my chamber-door,
another at the stairs-foot, and a third at the street-door;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and they would let none come at me, except
one sometimes, to bring me some necessary things.</p>

<p>At night, sometimes as late as the tenth hour, they
would bring up priests to me, who were exceeding
rude and devilish. There were a company of bitter
Scotch priests, Presbyterians, made up of envy and
malice, who were not fit to speak of the things of
God, they were so foul-mouthed. But the Lord, by
His power, gave me dominion over them all, and I
let them see both their fruits and their spirits. Great
ladies also (as they were called) came to see the man
that they said was to die. While the judge, justices,
and sheriff were contriving together how they might
put me to death, the Lord disappointed their design
by an unexpected way.<a name="FNanchor_66_91" id="FNanchor_66_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_91" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The next day, after the judges were gone out of
town, an order was sent to the jailer to put me down
into the prison amongst the moss-troopers,<a name="FNanchor_Z_92" id="FNanchor_Z_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_92" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> thieves,
and murderers; which accordingly he did. A filthy,
nasty place it was, where men and women were put
together in a very uncivil manner, and never a house
of office to it; and the prisoners were so lousy that
one woman was almost eaten to death with lice. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
bad as the place was, the prisoners were all made
very loving and subject to me, and some of them
were convinced of the Truth, as the publicans and
harlots were of old; so that they were able to confound
any priest that might come to the grates to
dispute.</p>

<p>But the jailer was cruel, and the under-jailer very
abusive both to me and to Friends that came to see
me; for he would beat with a great cudgel Friends
who did but come to the window to look in upon me.
I could get up to the grate, where sometimes I took
in my meat; at which the jailer was often offended.
Once he came in a great rage and beat me with his
cudgel, though I was not at the grate at that time;
and as he beat me, he cried, "Come out of the window,"
though I was then far from it. While he
struck me, I was moved in the Lord's power to sing,
which made him rage the more. Then he fetched a
fiddler, and set him to play, thinking to vex me. But
while he played, I was moved in the everlasting
power of the Lord God to sing; and my voice
drowned the noise of the fiddle, struck and confounded
them, and made them give over fiddling and
go their way.</p>

<p>Whilst I was in prison at Carlisle, James Parnell,
a little lad about sixteen years of age, came to see
me, and was convinced. The Lord quickly made him
a powerful minister of the Word of life, and many
were turned to Christ by him, though he lived not
long. For, travelling into Essex in the work of the
ministry, in the year 1655, he was committed to Colchester
castle, where he endured very great hardships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and sufferings. He was put by the cruel jailer
into a hole in the castle wall, called the oven, so high
from the ground that he went up to it by a ladder,
which being six feet too short, he was obliged to
climb from the ladder to the hole by a rope that was
fastened above. When Friends would have given
him a cord and a basket in which to draw up his
victuals, the inhuman jailer would not suffer
them, but forced him to go down and up by that
short ladder and rope to fetch his victuals, which for
a long time he did, or else he might have famished in
the hole.</p>

<p>At length his limbs became much benumbed with
lying in that place; yet being still obliged to go down
to take up some victuals, as he came up the ladder
again with his victuals in one hand, and caught at the
rope with the other, he missed the rope, and fell down
from a very great height upon the stones; by which
fall he was so wounded in the head, arms, and body,
that he died a short time after.<a name="FNanchor_67_93" id="FNanchor_67_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_93" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>While I thus lay in the dungeon at Carlisle, the
report raised at the time of the assize that I should
be put to death was gone far and near; insomuch that
the Parliament then sitting, which, I think, was
called the Little Parliament, hearing that a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
man at Carlisle was to die for religion, caused a letter
to be sent the sheriff and magistrates concerning me.</p>

<p>Not long after this the Lord's power came over
the justices, and they were made to set me at liberty.
But some time previous the governor and Anthony
Pearson came down into the dungeon, to see the
place where I was kept and understand what usage I
had had. They found the place so bad and the savour
so ill, that they cried shame on the magistrates for
suffering the jailer to do such things. They called
for the jailers into the dungeon, and required them
to find sureties for their good behaviour; and the
under-jailer, who had been such a cruel fellow, they
put into the dungeon with me, amongst the moss-troopers.</p>

<p>Now I went into the country, and had mighty
great meetings. The everlasting gospel and Word
of life flourished, and thousands were turned to the
Lord Jesus Christ, and to His teaching.</p>

<p>The priests and magistrates were in a great rage
against me in Westmoreland, and had a warrant to
apprehend me, which they renewed from time to
time, for a long time; yet the Lord did not suffer
them to serve it upon me. I travelled on amongst
Friends, visiting the meetings till I came to Swarthmore,
where I heard that the Baptists and professors
in Scotland had sent to have a dispute with me. I
sent them word that I would meet them in Cumberland,
at Thomas Bewley's house, whither accordingly
I went, but none of them came.</p>

<p>Some dangers at this time I underwent in my
travels; for at one time, as we were passing from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
meeting, and going through Wigton on a market-day,
the people of the town had set a guard with pitchforks;
and although some of their own neighbours
were with us, they kept us out of the town, and
would not let us pass through it, under the pretence
of preventing the sickness; though there was no occasion
for any such thing. However, they fell upon us,
and had like to have spoiled us and our horses; but
the Lord restrained them, that they did not much
hurt; and we passed away.</p>

<p>Another time, as I was passing between two
Friends' houses, some rude fellows lay in wait in a
lane, and exceedingly stoned and abused us; but at
last, through the Lord's assistance, we got through
them, and had not much hurt. But this showed the
fruits of the priest's teaching, which shamed their
profession of Christianity.</p>

<p>After I had visited Friends in that county, I went
through the county into Durham, having large meetings
by the way. A very large one I had at Anthony
Pearson's, where many were convinced. From
thence I passed through Northumberland to Derwentwater,
where there were great meetings; and the
priests threatened that they would come, but none
came. The everlasting Word of life was freely
preached, and freely received; and many hundreds
were turned to Christ, their teacher.</p>

<p>In Northumberland many came to dispute, of
whom some pleaded against perfection. Unto these I
declared that Adam and Eve were perfect before
they fell; that all that God made was perfect; that
the imperfection came by the devil, and the fall; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that Christ, who came to destroy the devil, said,
"Be ye perfect."</p>

<p>One of the professors alleged that Job said, "Shall
mortal man be more pure than his Maker? The
heavens are not clean in His sight. God charged His
angels with folly." But I showed him his mistake,
and let him see that it was not Job that said so, but
one of those that contended against Job; for Job
stood for perfection, and held his integrity; and they
were called miserable comforters.</p>

<p>Then these professors said that the outward body
was the body of death and sin. I showed them their
mistake in that also; for Adam and Eve had each of
them an outward body, before the body of death and
sin got into them; and that man and woman will have
bodies when the body of sin and death is put off
again; when they are renewed again into the image
of God by Christ Jesus, in which they were before
they fell. So they ceased at that time from opposing
further; and glorious meetings we had in the Lord's
power.</p>

<p>Then passed we to Hexam, where we had a great
meeting on top of a hill. The priest threatened that
he would come and oppose us, but he came not; so
all was quiet. And the everlasting day and renowned
Truth of the everliving God was sounded over those
dark countries, and His Son exalted over all. It was
proclaimed amongst the people that the day was now
come wherein all that made a profession of the Son
of God might receive Him; and that to as many as
would receive Him He would give power to become
the sons of God, as He had done to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>It was further declared that he who had the Son
of God, had life eternal; but he that had not the Son
of God, though he professed all the Scriptures from
the first of Genesis to the last of the Revelation, had
no life.</p>

<p>So after all were directed to the light of Christ, by
which they might see Him, receive Him, and know
where their true teacher was, and the everlasting
Truth had been largely declared amongst them, we
passed through Hexam peaceably, and came into
Gilsland, a country noted for thieving.</p>

<p>The next day we came into Cumberland again,
where we had a general meeting of thousands of people
on top of an hill near Langlands. A glorious and
heavenly meeting it was; for the glory of the Lord
did shine over all; and there were as many as one
could well speak over,<a name="FNanchor_AA_94" id="FNanchor_AA_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_94" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> the multitude was so great.
Their eyes were turned to Christ, their teacher; and
they came to sit under their own vine; insomuch that
Francis Howgill, coming afterwards to visit them,
found they had no need of words; for they were sitting
under their teacher Christ Jesus; in the sense
whereof He sat down amongst them, without speaking
anything.</p>

<p>A great convincement there was in Cumberland,
Bishoprick, Northumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire,
and Yorkshire; and the plants of God grew
and flourished, the heavenly rain descending, and
God's glory shining upon them. Many mouths were
opened by the Lord to His praise; yea, to babes and
sucklings he ordained strength.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish">A Visit to Oliver Cromwell</p>

<h3>1653-1654.</h3>


<p>About this time the priests and professors fell to
prophesying against us afresh. They had said long
before that we should be destroyed within a month;
and after that, they prolonged the time to half a
year. But that time being long expired, and we
mightily increased in number, they now gave forth
that we would eat out one another. For often after
meetings many tender people, having a great way to
go, tarried at Friends' houses by the way, and sometimes
more than there were beds to lodge in; so that
some lay on the hay-mows. Hereupon Cain's fear
possessed the professors and world's people; for they
were afraid that when we had eaten one another out,
we should all come to be maintained by the parishes,
and be chargeable to them.</p>

<p>But after awhile, when they saw that the Lord
blessed and increased Friends, as he did Abraham,
both in the field and in the basket, at their goings
forth and their comings in, at their risings up and
their lyings down, and that all things prospered with
them; then they saw the falseness of all their prophecies
against us, and that it was in vain to curse whom
God had blessed.</p>

<p>At the first convincement, when Friends could not
put off their hats to people, or say You to a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
person, but Thou and Thee;&mdash;when they could not
bow, or use flattering words in salutation, or adopt
the fashions and customs of the world, many Friends,
that were tradesmen of several sorts, lost their customers
at first, for the people were shy of them, and
would not trade with them; so that for a time some
Friends could hardly get money enough to buy
bread.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when people came to have experience
of Friends' honesty and faithfulness, and
found that their yea was yea, and their nay was nay;
that they kept to a word in their dealings, and would
not cozen and cheat, but that if a child were sent to
their shops for anything, he was as well used as his
parents would have been;&mdash;then the lives and conversation
of Friends did preach, and reached to the
witness of God in the people.</p>

<p>Then things altered so, that all the inquiry was,
"Where is there a draper, or shop-keeper, or tailor,
or shoemaker, or any other tradesman, that is a
Quaker?" Insomuch that Friends had more trade
than many of their neighbours, and if there was any
trading, they had a great part of it. Then the envious
professors altered their note, and began to cry
out, "If we let these Quakers alone, they will take
the trade of the nation out of our hands."<a name="FNanchor_68_95" id="FNanchor_68_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_95" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>This has been the Lord's doing to and for His people!
which my desire is that all who profess His holy
truth may be kept truly sensible of, and that all may
be preserved in and by His power and Spirit, faithful
to God and man. Faithful first to God, in obeying
Him in all things; and next in doing unto all
men that which is just and righteous in all things,
that the Lord God may be glorified in their practising
truth, holiness, godliness, and righteousness
amongst people in all their lives and conversation.</p>

<p>While Friends abode in the northern parts, a priest
of Wrexham, in Wales, named Morgan Floyd, having
heard reports concerning us, sent two of his congregation
into the north to inquire concerning us, to
try us, and bring him an account of us. When these
triers came amongst us, the power of the Lord seized
on them, and they were both convinced of the truth.
So they stayed some time with us, and then returned
to Wales; where afterwards one of them departed
from his convincement; but the other, named John-ap-John,
abode in the truth, and received a part in
the ministry, in which he continued faithful.<a name="FNanchor_69_96" id="FNanchor_69_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_96" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>About this time the oath or engagement to Oliver
Cromwell was tendered to the soldiers, many of
whom were disbanded because, in obedience to
Christ, they could not swear.<a name="FNanchor_70_97" id="FNanchor_70_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_97" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> John Stubbs, for one,
who was convinced when I was in Carlisle prison,
became a good soldier in the Lamb's war, and a faithful
minister of Christ Jesus; travelling much in the
service of the Lord in Holland, Ireland, Scotland,
Italy, Egypt, and America. And the Lord's power
preserved him from the hands of the papists, though
many times he was in great danger of the Inquisition.
But some of the soldiers, who had been convinced in
their judgment, but had not come into obedience to
the Truth, took Oliver Cromwell's oath; and, going
afterwards into Scotland, and coming before a garrison
there, the garrison, thinking they had been
enemies, fired at them, and killed divers of them,
which was a sad event.</p>

<p>When the churches were settled in the north, and
Friends were established under Christ's teaching, and
the glory of the Lord shined over them, I passed
from Swarthmore to Lancaster about the beginning
of the year 1654, visiting Friends, till I came to
Synder-hill green, where a meeting had been appointed
three weeks before. We passed through
Halifax, a rude town of professors, and came to
Thomas Taylor's, who had been a captain, where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
met with some janglers;<a name="FNanchor_AB_98" id="FNanchor_AB_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_98" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> but the Lord's power was
over all; for I travelled in the motion of God's
power.</p>

<p>When I came to Synder-hill green, there was a
mighty meeting. Some thousands of people, as it
was judged, were there, and many persons of note,
captains and other officers. There was a general convincement;
for the Lord's power and Truth was set
over all, and there was no opposition.</p>

<p>About this time did the Lord move upon the
spirits of many whom He had raised up and sent
forth to labour in His vineyard, to travel southwards,
and spread themselves in the service of the gospel to
the eastern, southern, and western parts of the
nation. Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough
went to London; John Camm and John Audland to
Bristol; Richard Hubberthorn and George Whitehead
towards Norwich; Thomas Holmes into Wales;
and many others different ways: for above sixty
ministers had the Lord raised up, and did now send
abroad out of the north country. The sense of their
service was very weighty upon me.<a name="FNanchor_71_99" id="FNanchor_71_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_99" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>About this time Rice Jones, of Nottingham, (who
had been a Baptist, and was turned Ranter), and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
company, began to prophesy against me; giving out
that I was then at the highest, and that after that
time I should fall down as fast. He sent a bundle of
railing papers from Nottingham to Mansfield, Clawson,
and the towns thereabouts, judging Friends for
declaring the Truth in the markets and in steeple-houses;
which papers I answered. But his and his
company's prophecies came upon themselves; for
soon after they fell to pieces, and many of his followers
became Friends, and continued so.</p>

<p>And through the Lord's blessed power, Truth and
Friends have increased, and do increase in the increase
of God: and I, by the same power, have been
and am preserved, and kept in the everlasting Seed,
that never fell, nor changes. But Rice Jones took
the oaths that were put to him, and so disobeyed the
command of Christ.</p>

<p>Many such false prophets have risen up against
me, but the Lord hath blasted them, and will blast all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
who rise against the blessed Seed, and me in that.
My confidence is in the Lord; for I saw their end, and
how the Lord would confound them, before He sent
me forth.</p>

<p>I travelled up and down in Yorkshire, as far as
Holderness, and to the land's end that way, visiting
Friends and the churches of Christ; which were
finely settled under Christ's teaching. At length I
came to Captain Bradford's house, whither came
many Ranters from York to wrangle; but they were
confounded and stopped. Thither came also she who
was called the Lady Montague, who was then convinced,
and lived and died in the Truth.</p>

<p>Thence I went to Drayton in Leicestershire to
visit my relations. As soon as I was come in, Nathaniel
Stephens, the priest, having got another
priest, and given notice to the country, sent to me to
come to them, for they could not do anything till I
came. Having been three years away from my relations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I knew nothing of their design. But at last I
went into the steeple-house yard, where the two
priests were; and they had gathered abundance of
people.</p>

<p>When I came there, they would have had me go
into the steeple-house. I asked them what I should
do there; and they said that Mr. Stephens could not
bear the cold. I told them he might bear it as well
as I. At last we went into a great hall, Richard
Farnsworth being with me; and a great dispute we
had with these priests concerning their practices, how
contrary they were to Christ and His apostles.</p>

<p>The priests would know where tithes were forbidden
or ended. I showed them out of the seventh
chapter to the Hebrews that not only tithes, but the
priesthood that took tithes, was ended; and the law
by which the priesthood was made, and tithes were
commanded to be paid, was ended and annulled.
Then the priests stirred up the people to some lightness
and rudeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>I had known Stephens from a child, therefore I
laid open his condition, and the manner of his preaching;
and how he, like the rest of the priests, did
apply the promises to the first birth, which must die.
But I showed that the promises were to the Seed,
not to many seeds, but to one Seed, Christ; who was
one in male and female; for all were to be born again
before they could enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Then he said, I must not judge so; but I told him
that He that was spiritual judged all things. Then
he confessed that that was a full Scripture; "but,
neighbours," said he, "this is the business; George
Fox is come to the light of the sun, and now he thinks
to put out my star-light."</p>

<p>I told him that I would not quench the least measure
of God in any, much less put out his star-light, if
it were true star-light&mdash;light from the Morning Star.
But, I told him, if he had anything from Christ or
God, he ought to speak it freely, and not take tithes
from the people for preaching, seeing that Christ
commanded His ministers to give freely, as they had
received freely. So I charged him to preach no more
for tithes or any hire. But he said he would not
yield to that.</p>

<p>After a while the people began to be vain and
rude, so we broke up; yet some were made loving to
the Truth that day. Before we parted I told them
that if the Lord would, I intended to be at the town
again that day week. In the interim I went into the
country, and had meetings, and came thither again
that day week.</p>

<p>Against that time this priest had got seven priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to help him; for priest Stephens had given notice at
a lecture on a market-day at Adderston, that such a
day there would be a meeting and a dispute with me.
I knew nothing of it; but had only said I should be
in town that day week again. These eight priests
had gathered several hundreds of people, even most
of the country thereabouts, and they would have had
me go into the steeple-house; but I would not go in,
but got on a hill, and there spoke to them and the
people.</p>

<p>There were with me Thomas Taylor, who had been
a priest, James Parnell, and several other Friends.
The priests thought that day to trample down Truth;
but the Truth overcame them. Then they grew light,
and the people rude; and the priests would not stand
trial with me; but would be contending here a little
and there a little, with one Friend or another. At
last one of the priests brought his son to dispute with
me; but his mouth was soon stopped. When he could
not tell how to answer, he would ask his father;
and his father was confounded also, when he came to
answer for his son.</p>

<p>So, after they had toiled themselves, they went
away in a rage to priest Stephens's house to drink.
As they went away, I said, "I never came to a place
where so many priests together would not stand the
trial with me." Thereupon they and some of their
wives came about me, laid hold of me, and fawningly
said, "What might you not have been, if it had not
been for the Quakers!"</p>

<p>Then they began to push Friends to and fro, to
thrust them from me, and to pluck me to themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
After a while several lusty fellows came, took me up
in their arms, and carried me into the steeple-house
porch, intending to carry me into the steeple-house
by force; but the door being locked they fell down in
a heap, having me under them. As soon as I could, I
got up from under them, and went to the hill again.
Then they took me from that place to the steeple-house
wall, and set me on something like a stool; and
all the priests being come back, stood under with the
people.</p>

<p>The priests cried, "Come, to argument, to argument."
I said that I denied all their voices, for they
were the voices of hirelings and strangers. They
cried, "Prove it, prove it." Then I directed them to
the tenth of John, where they might see what Christ
said of such. He declared that He was the true Shepherd
that laid down His life for His sheep, and His
sheep heard His voice and followed Him; but the
hireling would fly when the wolf came, because he
was a hireling. I offered to prove that they were
such hirelings. Then the priests plucked me off the
stool again; and they themselves got all upon stools
under the steeple-house wall.</p>

<p>Then I felt the mighty power of God arise over
all, and I told them that if they would but give audience,
and hear me quietly, I would show them by the
Scriptures why I denied those eight priests, or teachers,
that stood before me, and all the hireling
teachers of the world whatsoever; and I would give
them Scriptures for what I said. Whereupon both
priests and people consented. Then I showed them
out of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Micah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Malachi, and others, that they were in the steps of
such as God sent His true prophets to cry against.</p>

<p>When I appealed to that of God in their consciences,
the Light of Christ Jesus in them, they
could not abide to hear it. They had been all quiet
before; but then a professor said, "George, what!
wilt thou never have done?" I told him I should
have done shortly. I went on a little longer, and
cleared myself of them in the Lord's power. When
I had done, all the priests and people stood silent for
a time.</p>

<p>At last one of the priests said that they would read
the Scriptures I had quoted. I told them I desired
them to do so with all my heart. They began to read
the twenty-third of Jeremiah, where they saw the
marks of the false prophets that he cried against.
When they had read a verse or two I said, "Take
notice, people"; but the priests said, "Hold thy
tongue, George." I bade them read the whole chapter,
for it was all against them. Then they stopped,
and would read no further.</p>

<p>My father, though a hearer and follower of the
priest, was so well satisfied that he struck his cane
upon the ground, and said, "Truly, I see that he that
will but stand to the truth, it will bear him out."<a name="FNanchor_72_100" id="FNanchor_72_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_100" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>After this I went into the country, had several
meetings, and came to Swannington, where the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
came; but the meeting was quiet, the Lord's
power was over all, and the soldiers did not meddle.</p>

<p>Then I went to Leicester; and from Leicester to
Whetstone. There came about seventeen troopers
of Colonel Hacker's regiment, with his marshal, and
took me up before the meeting, though Friends were
beginning to gather together; for there were several
Friends from divers parts.<a name="FNanchor_73_101" id="FNanchor_73_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_101" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> I told the marshal he
might let all the Friends go; that I would answer for
them all. Thereupon he took me, and let all the
Friends go; only Alexander Parker went along with
me.</p>

<p>At night they had me before Colonel Hacker, his
major, and captains, a great company of them; and
a great deal of discourse we had about the priests,
and about meetings; for at this time there was a noise
of a plot against Oliver Cromwell. Much reasoning
I had with them about the Light of Christ, which
enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world.
Colonel Hacker asked whether it was not this Light
of Christ that made Judas betray his Master, and
afterwards led him to hang himself? I told him,
"No; that was the spirit of darkness, which hated
Christ and His Light."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Colonel Hacker said I might go home, and
keep at home, and not go abroad to meetings. I told
him I was an innocent man, free from plots, and
denied all such work. His son Needham said,
"Father, this man hath reigned too long; it is time
to have him cut off." I asked him, "For what?
What have I done? Whom have I wronged? I was
bred and born in this country, and who can accuse me
of any evil, from childhood up?" Colonel Hacker
asked me again if I would go home, and stay at home.
I told him that if I should promise him this, it would
manifest that I was guilty of something, to make my
home a prison; and if I went to meetings they would
say I broke their order. Therefore I told them I
should go to meetings as the Lord should order me,
and could not submit to their requirings; but I said
we were a peaceable people.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Colonel Hacker, "I will send
you to-morrow morning by six o'clock to my Lord
Protector, by Captain Drury, one of his life-guard."</p>

<p>That night I was kept prisoner at the Marshalsea;
and the next morning by the sixth hour I was delivered
to Captain Drury. I desired that he would let
me speak with Colonel Hacker before I went; and he
took me to his bedside. Colonel Hacker again admonished
me to go home, and keep no more meetings.
I told him I could not submit to that; but must have
my liberty to serve God, and to go to meetings.
"Then," said he, "you must go before the Protector."
Thereupon I kneeled at his bedside, and besought
the Lord to forgive him; for he was as Pilate,
though he would wash his hands; and I bade him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
remember, when the day of his misery and trial
should come upon him, what I had said to him. But
he was stirred up and set on by Stephens,<a name="FNanchor_74_102" id="FNanchor_74_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_102" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and the
other priests and professors, wherein their envy and
baseness was manifest. When they could not overcome
me by disputes and arguments, nor resist the
Spirit of the Lord that was in me, they got soldiers
to take me up.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when Colonel Hacker was imprisoned
in London, a day or two before his execution, he was
put in mind of what he had done against the innocent;
and he remembered it, and confessed it to Margaret
Fell, saying he knew well whom she meant; and
he had trouble upon him for it.</p>

<p>Now I was carried up a prisoner by Captain Drury
from Leicester; and when we came to Harborough
he asked me if I would go home and stay a fortnight?
I should have my liberty, he said, if I would not go
to, nor keep meetings. I told him I could not promise
any such thing. Several times upon the road did
he ask and try me after the same manner, and still I
gave him the same answers. So he brought me to
London, and lodged me at the Mermaid<a name="FNanchor_AC_103" id="FNanchor_AC_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_103" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> over against
the Mews at Charing-Cross.</p>

<p>As we travelled I was moved of the Lord to warn
people at the inns and places where I came of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
day of the Lord that was coming upon them. William
Dewsbury and Marmaduke Storr being in prison
at Northampton, Captain Drury let me go and visit
them.</p>

<p>After Captain Drury had lodged me at the Mermaid,
he left me there, and went to give the Protector
an account of me. When he came to me again,
he told me that the Protector required that I should
promise not to take up a carnal sword or weapon
against him or the government, as it then was, and
that I should write it in what words I saw good, and
set my hand to it. I said little in reply to Captain
Drury.</p>

<p>The next morning I was moved of the Lord to
write a paper to the Protector, Oliver Cromwell;
wherein I did, in the presence of the Lord God, declare
that I denied the wearing or drawing of a carnal
sword, or any other outward weapon, against him or
any man; and that I was sent of God to stand a witness
against all violence, and against the works of
darkness; and to turn people from darkness to light;
and to bring them from the causes of war and fighting,
to the peaceable gospel. When I had written
what the Lord had given me to write, I set my name
to it, and gave it to Captain Drury to hand to Oliver
Cromwell, which he did.</p>

<p>After some time Captain Drury brought me before
the Protector himself at Whitehall.<a name="FNanchor_75_104" id="FNanchor_75_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_104" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> It was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
morning, before he was dressed, and one Harvey,
who had come a little among Friends, but was disobedient,
waited upon him. When I came in I was
moved to say, "Peace be in this house"; and I
exhorted him to keep in the fear of God, that he
might receive wisdom from Him, that by it he might
be directed, and order all things under his hand to
God's glory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>I spoke much to him of Truth, and much discourse
I had with him about religion; wherein he carried
himself very moderately. But he said we quarrelled
with priests, whom he called ministers. I told him
I did not quarrel with them, but that they quarrelled
with me and my friends. "But," said I, "if we own
the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, we cannot hold
up such teachers, prophets, and shepherds, as the
prophets, Christ, and the apostles declared against;
but we must declare against them by the same power
and Spirit."</p>

<p>Then I showed him that the prophets, Christ, and
the apostles declared freely, and against them that
did not declare freely; such as preached for filthy
lucre, and divined for money, and preached for hire,
and were covetous and greedy, that could never have
enough; and that they that have the same spirit that
Christ, and the prophets, and the apostles had, could
not but declare against all such now, as they did then.
As I spoke, he several times said, it was very good,
and it was truth. I told him that all Christendom
(so called) had the Scriptures, but they wanted the
power and Spirit that those had who gave forth the
Scriptures; and that was the reason they were not in
fellowship with the Son, nor with the Father, nor
with the Scriptures, nor one with another.</p>

<p>Many more words I had with him; but people coming
in, I drew a little back. As I was turning, he
caught me by the hand, and with tears in his eyes
said, "Come again to my house; for if thou and I
were but an hour of a day together, we should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
nearer one to the other"; adding that he wished me
no more ill than he did to his own soul. I told him if
he did he wronged his own soul; and admonished him
to hearken to God's voice, that he might stand in his
counsel, and obey it; and if he did so, that would
keep him from hardness of heart; but if he did not
hear God's voice, his heart would be hardened. He
said it was true.</p>

<p>Then I went out; and when Captain Drury came
out after me he told me the Lord Protector had said
I was at liberty, and might go whither I would.</p>

<p>Then I was brought into a great hall, where the
Protector's gentlemen were to dine. I asked them
what they brought me thither for. They said it was
by the Protector's order, that I might dine with
them. I bid them let the Protector know that I
would not eat of his bread, nor drink of his drink.
When he heard this he said, "Now I see there is a
people risen that I cannot win with gifts or honours,
offices or places; but all other sects and people I
can." It was told him again that we had forsaken
our own possessions; and were not like to look for
such things from him.</p>

<p>Being set at liberty, I went to the inn where Captain
Drury at first lodged me. This captain, though
he sometimes carried it fairly, was an enemy to me
and to Truth, and opposed it. When professors came
to me, while I was under his custody, and he was by,
he would scoff at trembling, and call us Quakers, as
the Independents and Presbyterians had nicknamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
us before.<a name="FNanchor_76_105" id="FNanchor_76_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_105" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But afterwards he came and told me
that, as he was lying on his bed to rest himself in the
daytime, a sudden trembling seized on him; that his
joints knocked together, and his body shook so
that he could not rise from his bed. He was so
shaken that he had not strength enough left to rise.
But he felt the power of the Lord was upon him; and
he tumbled off his bed, and cried to the Lord, and said
he would never speak more against the Quakers, such
as trembled at the word of God.</p>

<p>During the time I was prisoner at Charing-Cross,
there came abundance to see me, almost of all sorts,
priests, professors, officers of the army, etc. Once a
company of officers, being with me, desired me to
pray with them. I sat still, with my mind retired to
the Lord. At last I felt the power and Spirit of God
move in me; and the Lord's power did so shake and
shatter them that they wondered, though they did
not live in it.</p>

<p>Among those that came was Colonel Packer, with
several of his officers. While they were with me,
there came in one Cob, and a great company of
Ranters with him. The Ranters began to call for
drink and tobacco; but I desired them to forbear it in
my room, telling them if they had such a mind to it,
they might go into another room. One of them cried,
"All is ours"; and another of them said, "All is
well." I replied, "How is all well, while thou art so
peevish, envious, and crabbed?" for I saw he was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a peevish nature. I spake to their conditions, and
they were sensible of it, and looked one upon another,
wondering.</p>

<p>Then Colonel Packer began to talk with a light,
chaffy mind, concerning God, and Christ, and the
Scriptures. It was a great grief to my soul and spirit
when I heard him talk so lightly; so that I told him
he was too light to talk of the things of God, for he
did not know the solidity of a man. Thereupon the
officers raged, and were wroth that I should speak so
of their colonel.</p>

<p>This Packer was a Baptist, and he and the Ranters
bowed and scraped to one another very much; for it
was the manner of the Ranters to be exceedingly
complimentary (as they call it), so that Packer bade
them give over their compliments. But I told them
they were fit to go together, for they were both of
one spirit.</p>

<p>This Colonel Packer lived at Theobald's, near
Waltham, and was made a justice of the peace. He
set up a great meeting of the Baptists at Theobald's
Park; for he and some other officers had purchased
it. They were exceedingly high, and railed against
Friends and Truth, and threatened to apprehend me
with their warrants if ever I came there.</p>

<p>Yet after I was set at liberty, I was moved of the
Lord God to go down to Theobald's, and appoint a
meeting hard by them; to which many of his people
came, and divers of his hearers were convinced of the
way of Truth, and received Christ, the free teacher,
and came off from the Baptist; and that made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
rage the more. But the Lord's power came over
him, so that he had not power to meddle with me.</p>

<p>Then I went to Waltham, close by him, and had a
meeting there; but the people were very rude, and
gathered about the house and broke the windows.
Thereupon I went out to them, with the Bible in my
hand, and desired them to come in; and told them
that I would show them Scripture both for our principles
and practices. When I had done so, I showed
them also that their teachers were in the steps of
such as the prophets, and Christ, and the apostles
testified against. Then I directed them to the Light
of Christ and Spirit of God in their own hearts, that
by it they might come to know their free teacher, the
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The meeting being ended, they went away quieted
and satisfied, and a meeting hath since been settled
in that town. But this was some time after I was
set at liberty by Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>When I came from Whitehall to the Mermaid at
Charing-Cross, I stayed not long there, but went
into the city of London, where we had great and
powerful meetings. So great were the throngs of
people that I could hardly get to and from the meetings
for the crowds; and the Truth spread exceedingly.
Thomas Aldam, and Robert Craven, who had
been sheriff of London, and many Friends, came up
to London after me; but Alexander Parker abode
with me.<a name="FNanchor_77_106" id="FNanchor_77_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_106" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>After a while I went to Whitehall again, and was
moved to declare the day of the Lord amongst them,
and that the Lord was come to teach His people Himself.
So I preached Truth, both to the officers, and
to them that were called Oliver's gentlemen, who
were of his guard. But a priest opposed while I was
declaring the Word of the Lord amongst them; for
Oliver had several priests about him, of which this
was his newsmonger, an envious priest, and a light,
scornful, chaffy man. I bade him repent, and he
put it in his newspaper the next week that I had been
at Whitehall and had bidden a godly minister there
to repent.</p>

<p>When I went thither again I met with him; and
abundance of people gathered about me. I manifested
the priest to be a liar in several things that he
had affirmed; and he was put to silence. He put in
the news that I wore silver buttons; which was false,
for they were but alchemy.<a name="FNanchor_78_107" id="FNanchor_78_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_107" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Afterwards he put in
the news that I hung ribands on people's arms, which
made them follow me. This was another of his lies,
for I never used nor wore ribands in my life.</p>

<p>Three Friends went to examine this priest, that
gave forth this false intelligence, and to know of
him where he had had that information. He said
it was a woman that told him so, and that if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
would come again he would tell them the woman's
name. When they came again he said it was a man,
but would not tell them his name then, but said that
if they would come again he would tell them his
name and where he lived.</p>

<p>They went the third time; and then he would not
say who told him; but offered, if I would give it
under my hand that there was no such thing he would
put that into the news. Thereupon the Friends carried
it to him under my hand; but when they came
he broke his promise, and would not put it in: but
was in a rage, and threatened them with the constable.</p>

<p>This was the deceitful doing of this forger of lies;
and these lies he spread over the nation in the news,
to render Truth odious and to put evil into people's
minds against Friends and Truth; of which a more
large account may be seen in a book printed soon
after this time, for the clearing of Friends and Truth
from the slanders and false reports raised and cast
upon them.</p>

<p>These priests, the newsmongers, were of the Independent
sect, like them in Leicester; but the Lord's
power came over all their lies, and swept them away;
and many came to see the naughtiness of these
priests. The God of heaven carried me over all in
His power, and His blessed power went over the nation;
insomuch that many Friends about this time
were moved to go up and down to sound forth the
everlasting gospel in most parts of this nation, and
also in Scotland; and the glory of the Lord was felt
over all, to His everlasting praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>A great convincement there was in London; some
in the Protector's house and family. I went to see
him again, but could not get to him, the officers were
grown so rude.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">A Visit to the Southern Counties Which Ends

<h3>1655-1656.</h3>


<p>It came upon me about this time from the Lord
to write a short paper and send it forth as an exhortation
and warning to the Pope, and to all kings and
rulers in Europe.</p>

<p>Besides this I was moved to write a letter to the
Protector (so called) to warn him of the mighty work
the Lord hath to do in the nations, and the shaking
of them; and to beware of his own wit, craft, subtilty,
and policy, and of seeking any by-ends to himself.<a name="FNanchor_79_108" id="FNanchor_79_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_108" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>I travelled till I came to Reading, where I found
a few that were convinced of the way of the Lord.
I stayed till the First-day, and had a meeting in
George Lamboll's orchard; and a great part of the
town came to it. A glorious meeting it proved; great
convincement there was, and the people were mightily
satisfied. Thither came two of Judge Fell's
daughters to me, and George Bishop, of Bristol, with
his sword by his side, for he was a captain.</p>

<p>After the meeting many Baptists and Ranters
came privately, reasoning and discoursing; but the
Lord's power came over them. The Ranters pleaded
that God made the devil. I denied it, and told them
I was come into the power of God, the seed Christ,
which was before the devil was, and bruised his head;
and he became a devil by going out of truth; and so
became a murderer and a destroyer. I showed them
that God did not make him a devil; for God is a God
of truth, and made all things good, and blessed them;
but God did not bless the devil. And the devil is
bad, and was a liar and a murderer from the beginning,
and spoke of himself, and not from God.</p>

<p>So the Truth stopped and bound them, and came
over all the highest notions in the nation, and confounded
them. For by the power of the Lord I was
manifest, and sought to be made manifest to the
Spirit of God in all, that by it they might be turned
to God; as many were turned to the Lord Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Christ by the Holy Spirit, and were come to sit under
His teaching.</p>

<p>After this I passed to London, where I stayed
awhile, and had large meetings; then went into Essex,
and came to Cogshall, where was a meeting of about
two thousand people, as it was judged, which lasted
several hours, and a glorious meeting it was. The
Word of life was freely declared, and people were
turned to the Lord Jesus Christ their Teacher and
Saviour, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>

<p>On the Sixth-day I had a large meeting near Colchester,
to which many professors and the Independent
teachers came. After I had done speaking, and
was stepped down from the place on which I stood,
one of the Independent teachers began to make a
jangling; which Amor Stoddart perceiving, said,
"Stand up again, George"; for I was going away,
and did not at first hear them. But when I heard
the Independent, I stood up again, and after awhile
the Lord's power came over him and his company;
they were confounded and the Lord's Truth went
over all. A great flock of sheep hath the Lord in that
country, that feed in His pastures of life.</p>

<p>On the First-day following we had a very large
meeting not far from Colchester, wherein the Lord's
power was eminently manifested, and the people were
very well satisfied; for, being turned to the Lord
Jesus Christ's free teaching, they received it gladly.
Many of these people were of the stock of the
martyrs.</p>

<p>As I passed through Colchester, I went to visit
James Parnell in prison; but the jailer would hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
let us come in or stay with him. Very cruel they
were to him. The jailer's wife threatened to have his
blood; and in that jail they did destroy him, as the
reader may see in a book printed soon after his death,
giving an account of his life and death; and also in
an epistle printed with his collected books and writings.</p>

<p>We came to Yarmouth, where there was a Friend,
Thomas Bond, in prison for the Truth of Christ, and
there stayed a while. There we had some service;
and some were turned to the Lord in that town.</p>

<p>Thence we rode to another town, about twenty
miles off, where were many tender people; and I was
moved of the Lord to speak to them, as I sat on my
horse, in several places as I passed along. We went
to another town about five miles beyond, and put up
our horses at an inn, Richard Hubberthorn and I
having travelled five and forty miles that day. There
were some Friendly people in the town; and we had
a tender, broken meeting amongst them, in the Lord's
power.</p>

<p>We bade the hostler have our horses ready by
three in the morning; for we intended to ride to
Lynn, about three and thirty miles, next morning.
But when we were in bed at our inn, about eleven at
night, the constable and officers came, with a great
rabble of people, into the inn. They said they were
come with a hue-and-cry from a justice of the peace
that lived near the town, about five miles off, where
I had spoken to the people in the streets, as I rode
along. They had been told to search for two horsemen,
that rode upon gray horses, and in gray clothes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
a house having been broken into the Seventh-day before
at night. We told them we were honest, innocent
men, and abhorred such things; yet they apprehended
us, and set a guard with halberts and pikes
upon us that night, calling upon some of those
Friendly people, with others, to watch us.</p>

<p>Next morning we were up betimes, and the constable,
with his guard, carried us before a justice of
the peace about five miles off. We took with us two
or three of the sufficient men of the town, who had
been with us at the great meeting at Captain Lawrence's,
and could testify that we lay both the Seventh-day
night and the First-day night at Captain
Lawrence's; and it was on the Seventh-day night that
they said the house was broken into.</p>

<p>During the time that I was a prisoner at the Mermaid
at Charing-Cross, this Captain Lawrence
brought several Independent justices to see me there,
with whom I had much discourse, at which they took
offence. For they pleaded for imperfection, and to
sin as long as they lived; but did not like to hear of
Christ teaching His people Himself, and making people
as clear, whilst here upon the earth, as Adam and
Eve were before they fell. These justices had plotted
together this mischief against me in the country, pretending
that a house was broken into, that they might
send their hue-and-cry after me. They were vexed,
also, and troubled, to hear of the great meeting at
John Lawrence's aforesaid; for a colonel was there
convinced that day who lived and died in the Truth.</p>

<p>But Providence so ordered that the constable carried
us to a justice about five miles onward in our way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
towards Lynn, who was not an Independent, as the
rest were. When we were brought before him he
began to be angry because we did not put off our
hats to him. I told him I had been before the Protector,
and he was not offended at my hat; and why
should he be offended at it, who was but one of his
servants? Then he read the hue-and-cry; and I told
him that that night wherein the house was said to
have been broken into, we were at Captain Lawrence's
house and that we had several men present
who could testify the truth thereof.</p>

<p>Thereupon the justice, having examined us and
them, said he believed we were not the men that had
broken into the house; but he was sorry, he said,
that he had no more against us. We told him he
ought not to be sorry for not having evil against us,
but ought rather to be glad; for to rejoice when he
got evil against people, as for housebreaking or the
like, was not a good mind in him.</p>

<p>It was a good while, however, before he could resolve
whether to let us go or send us to prison, and
the wicked constable stirred him up against us, telling
him we had good horses and that if it pleased him
he would carry us to Norwich jail. But we took hold
of the justice's confession that he believed we were
not the men that had broken into the house; and,
after we had admonished him to fear the Lord in his
day, the Lord's power came over him, so that he let
us go; so their snare was broken.</p>

<p>A great people was afterwards gathered to the
Lord in that town, where I was moved to speak to
them in the street, and whence the hue-and-cry came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Being set at liberty, we passed on to Cambridge.
When I came into the town the scholars, hearing of
me, were up, and were exceeding rude. I kept on
my horse's back, and rode through them in the Lord's
power; but they unhorsed Amor Stoddart before he
could get to the inn. When we were in the inn they
were so rude in the courts and in the streets that the
miners, colliers and carters could not be ruder. The
people of the house asked us what we would have for
supper. "Supper!" said I, "were it not that the
Lord's power is over them, these rude scholars look
as if they would pluck us in pieces and make a supper
of us." They knew I was so against the trade of
preaching, which they were there as apprentices to
learn, that they raged as greatly as ever Diana's
craftsmen did against Paul.</p>

<p>At this place John Crook met us.<a name="FNanchor_80_109" id="FNanchor_80_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_109" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> When it was
night the mayor of the town being friendly, came
and fetched me to his house;<a name="FNanchor_81_110" id="FNanchor_81_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_110" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and as we walked
through the streets there was a bustle in the town;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
but they did not know me, it being darkish. They
were in a rage, not only against me, but against the
mayor also; so that he was almost afraid to walk the
streets with me for the tumult. We sent for the
Friendly people, and had a fine meeting in the power
of God; and I stayed there all night.</p>

<p>Next morning, having ordered our horses to be
ready by the sixth hour, we passed peaceably out of
town. The destroyers were disappointed: for they
thought I would have stayed longer in the town, and
intended to have done us mischief; but our passing
away early in the morning frustrated their evil purposes
against us.</p>

<p>At Evesham I heard that the magistrates had cast
several Friends into divers prisons, and that, hearing
of my coming, they made a pair of high stocks. I
sent for Edward Pittaway, a Friend that lived near
Evesham, and asked him the truth of the thing. He
said it was so. I went that night with him to Evesham;
and in the evening we had a large, precious
meeting, wherein Friends and people were refreshed
with the Word of life, the power of the Lord.</p>

<p>Next morning I rode to one of the prisons, and
visited Friends there, and encouraged them. Then I
rode to the other prison, where were several prisoners.
Amongst them was Humphry Smith, who had
been a priest, but was now become a free minister
of Christ. When I had visited Friends at both prisons,
and was turned to go out of the town, I espied
the magistrates coming up the town, intending to
seize me in prison. But the Lord frustrated their
intent, the innocent escaped their snare, and God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
blessed power came over them all. But exceeding
rude and envious were the priests and professors
about this time in these parts.</p>

<p>I went from Evesham to Worcester, and had a
quiet and a precious meeting there. From Worcester
we went to Tewkesbury, where in the evening we
had a great meeting, to which came the priest of the
town with a great rabble of rude people.</p>

<p>Leaving Tewkesbury, we passed to Warwick, where
in the evening we had a meeting with many sober
people at a widow-woman's house. A precious meeting
we had in the Lord's power; several were convinced
and turned to the Lord. After the meeting
a Baptist in the company began to jangle; and the
bailiff of the town, with his officers, came in and said,
"What do these people here at this time of night?"
So he secured John Crook, Amor Stoddart, Gerrard
Roberts and me; but we had leave to go to our inn,
and to be forthcoming in the morning.</p>

<p>The next morning many rude people came into the
inn, and into our chambers, desperate fellows; but
the Lord's power gave us dominion over them. Gerrard
Roberts and John Crook went to the bailiff to
know what he had to say to us. He said we might go
our ways, for he had little to say to us. As we rode
out of town it lay upon me to ride to his house to
let him know that, the Protector having given forth
an instrument of government in which liberty of conscience
was granted, it was very strange that, contrary
to that instrument of government, he would
trouble peaceable people that feared God.</p>

<p>The Friends went with me, but the rude people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
gathered about us with stones. One of them took
hold of my horse's bridle and broke it; but the horse,
drawing back, threw him under him. Though the
bailiff saw this, yet he did not stop, nor so much as
rebuke the rude multitude; so that it was strange
we were not slain or hurt in the streets; for the people
threw stones and struck at us as we rode along
the town.</p>

<p>When we were quite out of the town I told
Friends that it was upon me from the Lord that I
must go back into the town again; and if any one of
them felt anything upon him from the Lord he might
follow me; the rest, that did not, might go on to
Dun-Cow. So I passed through the market in the
dreadful power of God, declaring the Word of life
to them; and John Crook followed me. Some struck
at me; but the Lord's power was over them, and gave
me dominion over all. I showed them their unworthiness
to claim the name of Christians, and the unworthiness
of their teachers, that had not brought
them into more sobriety; and what a shame they were
to Christianity.</p>

<p>Having cleared myself, I turned out of the town
again, and passed to Coventry, where we found the
people closed up with darkness. I went to the house
of a professor, where I had formerly been, and he
was drunk; which grieved my soul so that I did not
go into any house in the town; but rode into some of
the streets, and into the market-place. I felt that
the power of the Lord was over the town.</p>

<p>Then I went on to Dun-Cow, and had a meeting in
the evening, and some were turned to the Lord by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
His Spirit, as some also were at Warwick and at
Tewkesbury. We lay at Dun-Cow that night; we
met with John Camm, a faithful minister of the everlasting
gospel. In the morning there gathered a rude
company of priests and people who behaved more like
beasts than men, for some of them came riding on
horseback into the room where we were; but the
Lord gave us dominion over them.</p>

<p>Thence we passed into Leicestershire, and after
that to Baddesley in Warwickshire. Here William
Edmundson, who lived in Ireland, having some drawings
upon his spirit to come into England to see me,
met with me; by whom I wrote a few lines to Friends
then convinced in the north of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_82_111" id="FNanchor_82_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_111" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Friends:
</p>

<p>In that which convinced you, wait; that you may
have that removed you are convinced of. And all my
dear Friends, dwell in the life, and love, and power, and
wisdom of God, in unity one with another, and with
God; and the peace and wisdom of God fill all your
hearts that nothing may rule in you but the life which
stands in the Lord God.</p>

<p class="signature">
G. F.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>When these few lines were read amongst the
Friends in Ireland at their meeting, the power of the
Lord came upon all in the room.</p>

<p>From Baddesley we passed to Swannington and
Higham, and so into Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire,
having great meetings; and many were turned
to the Lord by His power and Spirit.</p>

<p>When we came to Baldock in Hertfordshire, I
asked if there was nothing in that town, no profession;
and it was answered me that there were some
Baptists, and a Baptist woman who was sick. John
Rush, of Bedfordshire, went with me to visit her.</p>

<p>When we came in there were many tender people
about her. They told me she was not a woman for
this world, but if I had anything that would comfort
her concerning the world to come, I might speak to
her. I was moved of the Lord God to speak to her;
and the Lord raised her up again, to the astonishment
of the town and country. This Baptist woman and
her husband, whose name was Baldock, came to be
convinced, and many hundreds of people have met at
their house since. Great meetings and convincements
were in those parts afterwards; many received
the Word of life, and sat down under the teaching of
Christ, their Saviour.</p>

<p>When we had visited this sick woman we returned
to our inn, where were two desperate fellows fighting
so furiously that none durst come nigh to part them.
But I was moved, in the Lord's power, to go to them;
and when I had loosed their hands, I held one of
them by one hand and the other by the other, showed
them the evil of their doings, and reconciled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
one to the other; and they were so loving and thankful
to me that people marveled at it.<a name="FNanchor_83_112" id="FNanchor_83_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_112" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Now, after I had tarried some time in London, and
had visited Friends in their meetings, I went out of
town, leaving James Nayler in the city. As I passed
from him I cast my eyes upon him, and a fear struck
me concerning him; but I went away and rode down
to Ryegate, in Surrey, where I had a little meeting.<a name="FNanchor_84_113" id="FNanchor_84_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_113" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
There the Friends told me of one Thomas Moore, a
justice of the peace, that lived not far from Ryegate,
a Friendly, moderate man. I went to visit him at his
house, and he came to be a serviceable man in Truth.</p>

<p>Thence we went to Dorchester, and alighted at an
inn, a Baptist's house. We sent into the town to the
Baptists, to ask them to let us have their meeting-house
to assemble in, and to invite the sober people
to the meeting; but they denied it us. We sent to
them again, to know why they would deny us their
meeting-house, so the thing was noised about in the
town. Then we sent them word that if they would
not let us come to their house, they, or any people
that feared God, might come to our inn, if they
pleased; but they were in a great rage. Their teacher
and many of them came up, and slapped their Bibles
on the table.</p>

<p>I asked them why they were so angry,&mdash;"Were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
they angry with the Bible?" But they fell into a discourse
about their water-baptism. I asked them
whether they could say they were sent of God to baptize
people, as John was, and whether they had the
same Spirit and power that the apostles had? They
said they had not.</p>

<p>Then I asked them how many powers there are,&mdash;whether
there are any more than the power of God
and the power of the devil. They said there was not
any other power than those two. Then said I, "If
you have not the power of God that the apostles had,
you act by the power of the devil." Many sober people
were present, who said they have thrown themselves
on their backs. Many substantial people were
convinced that night; a precious service we had there
for the Lord, and His power came over all.</p>

<p>Next morning, as we were passing away, the Baptists,
being in a rage, began to shake the dust off
their feet after us. "What," said I, "in the power
of darkness! We, who are in the power of God,
shake off the dust of our feet against you."</p>

<p>Leaving Dorchester, we came to Weymouth;
where also we inquired after sober people; and about
fourscore of them gathered together at a priest's
house. Most of them received the Word of life and
were turned to their teacher, Christ Jesus, who had
enlightened them with His divine Light, by which
they might see their sins, and Him who saveth from
sin. A blessed meeting we had with them, and they
received the Truth in the love of it, with gladness of
heart.</p>

<p>The meeting held several hours. The state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
their teachers, and their apostasy was opened to
them; and the state of the apostles, and of the Church
in their days; and the state of the law and of the
prophets before Christ, and how Christ came to fulfill
them; that He was their teacher in the apostles' days;
and that He was come now to teach His people Himself
by His power and spirit. All was quiet, the
meeting broke up peaceably, the people were very
loving; and a meeting is continued in that town to
this day. Many are added to them; and some who
had been Ranters came to own the Truth, and to live
very soberly.</p>

<p>There was a captain of horse in the town, who
sent to me, and would fain have had me stay longer;
but I was not to stay. He and his man rode out of
town with me about seven miles; Edward Pyot also
being with me. This captain was the fattest, merriest,
cheerfullest man, and the most given to laughter,
that ever I met with: insomuch that I was several
times moved to speak in the dreadful power of the
Lord to him; yet it was become so customary to him
that he would presently laugh at anything he saw.
But I still admonished him to come to sobriety, and
the fear of the Lord and sincerity.</p>

<p>We lay at an inn that night, and the next morning
I was moved to speak to him again, when he parted
from us. The next time I saw him he told me that
when I spoke to him at parting, the power of the
Lord so struck him that before he got home he was
serious enough, and discontinued his laughing. He
afterwards was convinced, and became a serious and
good man, and died in the Truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>After this we passed to Totness, a dark town. We
lodged there at an inn; and that night Edward Pyot
was sick, but the Lord's power healed him, so that the
next day we got to Kingsbridge, and at our inn inquired
for the sober people of the town. They directed
us to Nicholas Tripe and his wife; and we
went to their house. They sent for the priest, with
whom we had some discourse; but he, being confounded,
quickly left us. Nicholas Tripe and his
wife were convinced; and since that time there has
been a good meeting of Friends in that country.</p>

<p>In the evening we returned to our inn. There being
many people drinking in the house, I was moved
of the Lord to go amongst them, and to direct them
to the Light with which Christ, the heavenly man,
had enlightened them; by which they might see all
their evil ways, words, and deeds, and by the same
Light might also see Christ Jesus their Saviour.</p>

<p>The innkeeper stood uneasy, seeing it hindered his
guests from drinking; and as soon as the last words
were out of my mouth he snatched up the candle, and
said, "Come, here is a light for you to go into your
chamber." Next morning, when he was cool, I represented
to him what an uncivil thing it was for him
so to do; then, warning him of the day of the Lord,
we got ready and passed away.</p>

<p>We came next day to Plymouth, refreshed ourselves
at our inn, and went to Robert Cary's, where
we had a very precious meeting. At this meeting
was Elizabeth Trelawny, daughter to a baronet. She
being somewhat thick of hearing, came close up to
me, and clapped her ear very nigh me while I spake;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and she was convinced. After this meeting came in
some jangling Baptists; but the Lord's power came
over them, and Elizabeth Trelawny gave testimony
thereto. A fine meeting was settled there in the
Lord's power, which hath continued ever since, where
many faithful Friends have been convinced.</p>

<p>Thence we passed into Cornwall, and came to an
inn in the parish of Menheriot. At night we had a
meeting at Edward Hancock's, to which came
Thomas Mounce and a priest, with many people. We
brought the priest to confess that he was a minister
made by the state, and maintained by the state; and
he was confounded and went his way; but many of
the people stayed.</p>

<p>I directed them to the Light of Christ, by which
they might see their sins; and their Saviour Christ
Jesus, the way to God, their Mediator, to make peace
betwixt God and them; their Shepherd to feed them,
and their Prophet to teach them. I directed them
to the Spirit of God in themselves, by which they
might know the Scriptures, and be led into all Truth;
and by the Spirit might know God, and in it have
unity one with another. Many were convinced at
that time, and came under Christ's teaching; and
there are fine gatherings in the name of Jesus in
those parts at this day.</p>

<p>When we came to Ives, Edward Pyot's horse having
cast a shoe, we stayed to have it set; and while he
was getting his horse shod, I walked down to the seaside.
When I returned I found the town in an uproar.
They were haling Edward Pyot and the other
Friend before Major Peter Ceely, a major in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
army and a justice of the peace. I followed them
into the justice's house, though they did not lay
hands upon me.</p>

<p>When we came in, the house was full of rude people;
whereupon I asked if there were not an officer
among them to keep the people civil. Major Ceely
said that he was a magistrate. I told him that he
should then show forth gravity and sobriety, and use
his authority to keep the people civil; for I never saw
any people ruder; the Indians were more like Christians
than they.</p>

<p>After a while they brought forth a paper,
and asked whether I would own it.<a name="FNanchor_AD_114" id="FNanchor_AD_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_114" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> I said,
Yes. Then he tendered the oath of abjuration to us;
whereupon I put my hand in my pocket and drew
forth the answer to it which I had given to the Protector.
After I had given him that, he examined us
severally, one by one. He had with him a silly young
priest, who asked us many frivolous questions; and
amongst the rest he desired to cut my hair, which
was then pretty long; but I was not to cut it, though
many times many were offended at it. I told them
I had no pride in it, and it was not of my own
putting on.</p>

<p>At length the justice put us under a guard of soldiers,
who were hard and wild, like the justice himself;
nevertheless we warned the people of the day
of the Lord, and declared the Truth to them. The
next day he sent us, guarded by a party of horse with
swords and pistols, to Redruth. On First-day the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
would have taken us away; but we told them it
was their Sabbath, and it was not usual to travel on
that day.</p>

<p>Several of the townspeople gathered about us, and
whilst I held the soldiers in discourse, Edward Pyot
spoke to the people; and afterwards he held the soldiers
in discourse, whilst I spoke to the people. In
the meantime the other Friend got out the back way,
and went to the steeple-house to speak to the priest
and people. The people were exceedingly desperate,
in a mighty rage against him, and they sorely
abused him. The soldiers also, missing him, were in
a great rage, ready to kill us; but I declared the day
of the Lord and the Word of eternal life to the people
that gathered about us.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the soldiers were resolved to take
us away, so we took horse. When we were come to
the town's end I was moved of the Lord to go back
again, to speak to the old man of the house. The
soldiers drew out their pistols, and swore I should
not go back. I heeded them not, but rode back, and
they rode after me. I cleared myself to the old man
and the people, and then returned with them, and reproved
them for being so rude and violent.</p>

<p>At night we were brought to a town then called
Smethick, but since known as Falmouth. It being
the evening of the First-day, there came to our inn
the chief constable of the place, and many sober people,
some of whom began to inquire concerning us.
We told them we were prisoners for Truth's sake;
and much discourse we had with them concerning the
things of God. They were very sober and loving to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
us. Some were convinced, and stood faithful ever
after.</p>

<p>When the constable and these people were gone,
others came in, who were also very civil, and went
away very loving. When all were gone, we went to
our chamber to go to bed; and about the eleventh
hour Edward Pyot said, "I will shut the door; it
may be some may come to do us mischief." Afterwards
we understood that Captain Keat, who commanded
the party, had intended to do us some injury
that night; but the door being bolted, he missed his
design.</p>

<p>Next morning Captain Keat brought a kinsman
of his, a rude, wicked man, and put him into the
room; himself standing without. This evil-minded
man walked huffing up and down the room; I bade
him fear the Lord. Thereupon he ran upon me,
struck me with both his hands, and, clapping his leg
behind me, would have thrown me down if he could;
but he was not able, for I stood stiff and still, and
let him strike.</p>

<p>As I looked towards the door, I saw Captain Keat
look on, and see his kinsman thus beat and abuse me.
I said to him, "Keat, dost thou allow this?" He
said he did. "Is this manly or civil," said I, "to
have us under a guard, and then put a man to abuse
and beat us? Is this manly, civil, or Christian?" I
desired one of our friends to send for the constables,
and they came.</p>

<p>Then I desired the Captain to let the constables
see his warrant or order, by which he was to carry
us; which he did. His warrant was to conduct us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
safe to Captain Fox, governor of Pendennis Castle;
and if the governor should not be at home, he was to
convey us to Launceston jail. I told him he had
broken his order concerning us; for we, who were
his prisoners, were to be safely conducted; but he
had brought a man to beat and abuse us; so he having
broken his order, I wished the constable to keep
the warrant. Accordingly he did, and told the soldiers
they might go their ways, for he would take
charge of the prisoners; and if it cost twenty shillings
in charges to carry us up, they should not have the
warrant again. I showed the soldiers the baseness of
their carriage towards us; and they walked up and
down the house, pitifully blank and down.</p>

<p>The constables went to the castle, and told the
officers what they had done. The officers showed
great dislike of Captain Keat's base carriage towards
us; and told the constables that Major-General Desborough
was coming to Bodmin, and that we should
meet him; and it was likely he would free us. Meanwhile
our old guard of soldiers came by way of entreaty
to us, and promised that they would be civil
to us if we would go with them.</p>

<p>Thus the morning was spent till about the eleventh
hour; and then, upon the soldiers' entreaty, and their
promise to be more civil, the constables gave them
the order again; and we went with them.</p>

<p>Great was the civility and courtesy of the constables
and people of that town towards us. They
kindly entertained us, and the Lord rewarded them
with His truth; for many of them have since been
convinced thereof, and are gathered into the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of Jesus, and sit under Christ, their Teacher and
Saviour.</p>

<p>Captain Keat, who commanded our guard, understanding
that Captain Fox, who was governor of
Pendennis Castle, was gone to meet Major-General
Desborough,<a name="FNanchor_85_115" id="FNanchor_85_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_115" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> did not carry us thither; but took us
directly to Bodmin, in the way to Launceston. We
met Major-General Desborough on the way. The
captain of his troop, who rode before him, knew me,
and said, "Oh, Mr. Fox, what do you here?" I replied,
"I am a prisoner." "Alack," he said, "for
what?" I told him I was taken up as I was travelling.
"Then," said he, "I will speak to my lord,
and he will set you at liberty."</p>

<p>So he came from the head of his troop, and rode
up to the coach, and spoke to the Major-General.
We also gave him an account of how we were taken.
He began to speak against the Light of Christ;
against which I exhorted him. Then he told the soldiers
that they might carry us to Launceston; for he
could not stay to talk with us, lest his horses should
take cold.</p>

<p>To Bodmin we were taken that night; and when
we came to our inn Captain Keat, who was in before
us, put me into a room and went his way. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
was come in, there stood a man with a naked rapier in
his hand. Whereupon I turned out again, called for
Captain Keat, and said, "What now, Keat; what
trick hast thou played now, to put me into a room
where there is a man with his naked rapier? What
is thy end in this?" "Oh," said he, "pray hold
your tongue; for if you speak to this man, we cannot
rule him, he is so devilish." "Then," said I,
"dost thou put me into a room where there is such
a man with a naked rapier that thou sayest you cannot
rule him? What an unworthy, base trick is
this? and to put me single into this room, away from
my friends that were fellow-prisoners with me?"
Thus his plot was discovered and the mischief they
intended was prevented.</p>

<p>Afterward we got another room, where we were
together all night; and in the evening we declared
the Truth to the people; but they were dark and
hardened. The soldiers, notwithstanding their fair
promises, were very rude and wicked to us again, and
sat up drinking and roaring all night.</p>

<p>Next day we were brought to Launceston, where
Captain Keat delivered us to the jailer. Now was
there no Friend, nor Friendly people, near us; and
the people of the town were a dark, hardened people.
The jailer required us to pay seven shillings a
week for our horse-meat,<a name="FNanchor_AE_116" id="FNanchor_AE_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_116" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> and seven shillings a week
apiece for our diet. After some time several sober
persons came to see us, and some people of the town
were convinced, and many friendly people out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
several parts of the country came to visit us, and
were convinced.</p>

<p>Then got up a great rage among the professors
and priests against us. They said, "This people
'Thou' and 'Thee' all men without respect and will
not put off their hats, nor bow the knee to any man;
but we shall see, when the assize comes, whether they
will dare to 'Thou' and 'Thee' the judge, and keep
on their hats before him." They expected we should
be hanged at the assize.</p>

<p>But all this was little to us; for we saw how God
would stain the world's honour and glory; and were
commanded not to seek that honour, nor give it; but
knew the honour that cometh from God only, and
sought that.</p>

<p>It was nine weeks from the time of our commitment
to the time of the assizes, to which abundance
of people came from far and near to hear the trial
of the Quakers. Captain Bradden lay there with his
troop of horse. His soldiers and the sheriff's men
guarded us to the court through the multitude that
filled the streets; and much ado they had to get us
through. Besides, the doors and windows were filled
with people looking upon us.</p>

<p>When we were brought into the court, we stood a
while with our hats on, and all was quiet. I was
moved to say, "Peace be amongst you."</p>

<p>Judge Glynne, a Welshman, then Chief-Justice
of England, said to the jailer, "What be these you
have brought here into the court?" "Prisoners, my
lord," said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you not put off your hats?" said the
Judge to us. We said nothing.</p>

<p>"Put off your hats," said the Judge again. Still
we said nothing. Then said the Judge, "The Court
commands you to put off your hats."</p>

<p>Then I spoke, and said, "Where did ever any magistrate,
king, or judge, from Moses to Daniel, command
any to put off their hats, when they came
before him in his court, either amongst the Jews, the
people of God, or amongst the heathen?<a name="FNanchor_86_117" id="FNanchor_86_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_117" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and if the
law of England doth command any such thing, show
me that law either written or printed."</p>

<p>Then the Judge grew very angry, and said, "I do
not carry my law-books on my back." "But," said
I, "tell me where it is printed in any statute-book,
that I may read it."</p>

<p>Then said the Judge, "Take him away, prevaricator!
I'll <em>ferk</em> him." So they took us away, and
put us among the thieves.</p>

<p>Presently after he calls to the jailer, "Bring them
up again." "Come," said he, "where had they hats,
from Moses to Daniel; come, answer me: I have you
fast now."</p>

<p>I replied, "Thou mayest read in the third of
Daniel, that the three children were cast into the
fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar's command, with
their coats, their hose, and their hats on."</p>

<p>This plain instance stopped him: so that, not having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
anything else to say to the point, he cried again,
"Take them away, jailer."</p>

<p>Accordingly we were taken away, and thrust in
among the thieves, where we were kept a great
while; and then, without being called again, the
sheriff's men and the troopers made way for us (but
we were almost spent) to get through the crowd of
people, and guarded us to the prison again, a multitude
of people following us, with whom we had much
discourse and reasoning at the jail.</p>

<p>We had some good books to set forth our principles,
and to inform people of the Truth. The Judge
and justices hearing of this, they sent Captain Bradden
for them. He came into the jail to us, and violently
took our books from us, some out of Edward
Pyot's hands, and carried them away; so we never
got them again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[While in the jail Fox addressed a paper "against
swearing" to the grand and petty juries.]</p></blockquote>

<p>This paper passing among them from the jury to
the justices, they presented it to the Judge; so that
when we were called before the Judge, he bade the
clerk give me that paper, and then asked me whether
that seditious paper was mine. I said to him, "If
they will read it out in open court, that I may hear
it, if it is mine I will own it, and stand by it." He
would have had me take it and look upon it in my
own hand; but I again desired that it might be read,
that all the country might hear it, and judge whether
there was any sedition in it or not; for if there were,
I was willing to suffer for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the clerk of the assize read it, with an audible
voice, that all the people might hear it. When
he had done I told them it was my paper; that I
would own it, and so might they too, unless they
would deny the Scripture: for was not this Scripture
language, and the words and commands of
Christ, and the Apostle, which all true Christians
ought to obey?</p>

<p>Then they let fall that subject; and the Judge fell
upon us about our hats again, bidding the jailer take
them off; which he did, and gave them to us; and we
put them on again. Then we asked the Judge and
the justices, for what cause we had lain in prison
these nine weeks, seeing they now objected to
nothing but our hats. And as for putting off our
hats, I told them that that was the honour which
God would lay in the dust, though they made so
much ado about it; the honour which is of men, and
which men seek one of another, and is a mark of unbelievers.
For "How can ye believe," saith Christ,
"who receive honour one of another, and seek not
the honour that cometh from God only?" Christ
saith, "I receive not honour from men"; and all true
Christians should be of His mind.</p>

<p>Then the Judge began to make a pompous speech,
how he represented the Lord Protector's person, who
made him Lord Chief-Justice of England, and sent
him to come that circuit, etc. We desired him, then,
that he would do us justice for our false imprisonment
which we had suffered nine weeks wrongfully.
But instead of that, they brought an indictment
framed against us; so full of lies that I thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
had been against some of the thieves,&mdash;"that we
came by force and arms, and in a hostile manner, into
the court"; who were brought as aforesaid. I told
them it was all false; and still we cried for justice for
our false imprisonment, being taken up in our journey
without cause by Major Ceely.</p>

<p>Then Peter Ceely said to the Judge, "May it
please you, my lord, this man (pointing to me) went
aside with me, and told me how serviceable I might
be for his design; that he could raise forty thousand
men at an hour's warning, involve the nation in
blood, and so bring in King Charles. I would have
aided him out of the country, but he would not go.
If it please you, my lord, I have a witness to swear
it."</p>

<p>So he called upon his witness; but the Judge not
being forward to examine the witness, I desired that
he would be pleased to let my mittimus be read in
the face of the court and the country, in which the
crime was signified for which I was sent to prison.
The Judge said it should not be read. I said, "It
ought to be, seeing it concerned my liberty and my
life." The Judge said again, "It shall not be read."
I said, "It ought to be read; for if I have done anything
worthy of death, or of bonds, let all the country
know it."</p>

<p>Then seeing they would not read it, I spoke to one
of my fellow-prisoners: "Thou hast a copy of it;
read it up." "It shall not be read," said the Judge;
"jailer, take him away. I'll see whether he or I shall
be master."</p>

<p>So I was taken away, and awhile after called for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
again. I still called to have the mittimus read; for
that signified the cause of my commitment. I again
spoke to the Friend, my fellow-prisoner, to read it
up; which he did. The Judge, justices, and the whole
court were silent; for the people were eager to hear
it. It was as followeth:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">"Peter Ceely, one of the justices of the peace of this
county, to the keeper of His Highness's jail at
Launceston, or his lawful deputy in that behalf,
greeting:</p>

<p>"I send you here withal by the bearers hereof,
the bodies of Edward Pyot, of Bristol, and George
Fox, of Drayton-in-the-Clay, in Leicestershire, and
William Salt, of London, which they pretend to be
the places of their habitations, who go under the
notion of Quakers, and acknowledge themselves to be
such; who have spread several papers tending to the
disturbance of the public peace, and cannot render
any lawful cause of coming into those parts, being
persons altogether unknown, having no pass for
travelling up and down the country, and refusing to
give sureties for their good behaviour, according to
the law in that behalf provided; and refuse to take
oath of abjuration, etc. These are, therefore, in the
name of his highness the Lord Protector, to will and
command you, that when the bodies of the said Edward
Pyot, George Fox, and William Salt, shall be
unto you brought, you them receive, and in His
Highness's prison aforesaid you safely keep them,
until by due course of law they shall be delivered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Hereof fail you not, as you will answer the contrary
at your perils. Given under my hand and seal, at
St. Ives, the 18th day of January, 1655.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">P. Ceely.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>When it was read I spoke thus to the Judge and
justices:</p>

<p>"Thou that sayest thou art Chief-Justice of England,
and you justices, know that, if I had put in
sureties, I might have gone whither I pleased, and
have carried on the design (if I had had one) with
which Major Ceely hath charged me. And if I had
spoken those words to him, which he hath here declared,
judge ye whether bail or mainprize could have
been taken in that case."</p>

<p>Then, turning my speech to Major Ceely, I said:</p>

<p>"When or where did I take thee aside? Was not
thy house full of rude people, and thou as rude as
any of them, at our examination; so that I asked for
a constable or some other officer to keep the people
civil? But if thou art my accuser, why sittest thou
on the bench? It is not the place of accusers to sit
with the judge. Thou oughtest to come down and
stand by me, and look me in the face.</p>

<p>"Besides, I would ask the Judge and justices
whether Major Ceely is not guilty of this treason,
which he charges against me, in concealing it so long
as he hath done? Does he understand his place,
either as a soldier or a justice of the peace? For he
tells you here that I went aside with him, and told
him what a design I had in hand, and how serviceable
he might be for my design: that I could raise forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
thousand men in an hour's time, bring in King
Charles, and involve the nation in blood. He saith,
moreover, that he would have aided me out of the
country, but I would not go; and therefore he committed
me to prison for want of sureties for the good
behaviour, as the mittimus declares.</p>

<p>"Now, do you not see plainly that Major Ceely
is guilty of this plot and treason he talks of, and hath
made himself a party to it by desiring me to go out
of the country, demanding bail of me, and not charging
me with this pretended treason till now, nor discovering
it? But I deny and abhor his words, and
am innocent of his devilish design."</p>

<p>So that business was let fall; for the Judge saw
clearly enough that instead of ensnaring me, Major
Ceely had ensnared himself.</p>

<p>Major Ceely got up again, and said, "If it please
you, my lord, to hear me: this man struck me, and
gave me such a blow as I never had in my life." At
this I smiled in my heart, and said, "Major Ceely,
art thou a justice of the peace, and a major of a troop
of horse, and tellest the Judge, in the face of the
court and country, that I, a prisoner, struck thee
and gave thee such a blow as thou never hadst the
like in thy life? What! art thou not ashamed?
Prithee, Major Ceely," said I, "where did I strike
thee? and who is thy witness for that? who was
by?"</p>

<p>He said it was in the Castle-Green, and Captain
Bradden was standing by when I struck him. I desired
the Judge to let him produce his witness for
that; and called again upon Major Ceely to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
down from the bench, telling him that it was not fit
that the accuser should sit as judge over the accused.
When I called again for his witness he said that Captain
Bradden was his witness.</p>

<p>Then I said, "Speak, Captain Bradden, didst thou
see me give him such a blow, and strike him as he
saith?" Captain Bradden made no answer; but
bowed his head towards me. I desired him to speak
up, if he knew any such thing; but he only bowed
his head again. "Nay," said I, "speak up, and let
the court and country hear, and let not bowing of
the head serve the turn. If I have done so, let the
law be inflicted on me; I fear not sufferings, nor
death itself, for I am an innocent man concerning all
this charge."</p>

<p>But Captain Bradden never testified to it; and the
Judge, finding those snares would not hold, cried,
"Take him away, jailer;" and then, when we were
taken away, he fined us twenty marks apiece for not
putting off our hats; and sentenced us to be kept in
prison till we paid it; so he sent us back to the jail.</p>

<p>At night Captain Bradden came to see us, and
seven or eight justices with him, who were very civil
to us, and told us they believed neither the Judge
nor any in the court gave credit to the charges which
Major Ceely had brought forward against me in the
face of the country. And Captain Bradden said that
Major Ceely had an intent to take away my life if
he could have got another witness.</p>

<p>"But," said I, "Captain Bradden, why didst not
thou witness for me, or against me, seeing Major
Ceely produced thee for a witness, that thou saw me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
strike him? and when I desired thee to speak either
for me or against me, according to what thou saw or
knew, thou wouldst not speak."</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "when Major Ceely and I came
by you, as you were walking in the Castle-Green, he
put off his hat to you, and said, 'How do you do, Mr.
Fox? Your servant, Sir.' Then you said to him,
'Major Ceely, take heed of hypocrisy, and of a rotten
heart: for when came I to be thy master, and
thou my servant? Do servants cast their masters
into prison?' This was the great blow he meant
you gave him."</p>

<p>Then I called to mind that they walked by us, and
that he spoke so to me, and I to him; which hypocrisy
and rotten-heartedness he manifested openly,
when he complained of this to the Judge in open
court, and in the face of the country; and would
have made them all believe that I struck him outwardly
with my hand.</p>

<p>There came also to see us one Colonel Rouse a justice
of the peace, and a great company with him. He
was as full of words and talk as ever I heard any
man in my life, so that there was no speaking to him.
At length I asked him whether he had ever been at
school, and knew what belonged to questions and
answers; (this I said to stop him).</p>

<p>"At school!" said he, "Yes."</p>

<p>"At school!" said the soldiers; "doth he say so
to our colonel, that is a scholar?"</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "if he be so, let him be still and
receive answers to what he hath said."</p>

<p>Then I was moved to speak the Word of life to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
him in God's dreadful power; which came so over
him that he could not open his mouth. His face
swelled, and was red like a turkey; his lips moved,
and he mumbled something; but the people thought
he would have fallen down. I stepped up to him,
and he said he was never so in his life before: for the
Lord's power stopped the evil power in him; so that
he was almost choked.</p>

<p>The man was ever after very loving to Friends,
and not so full of airy words to us; though he was
full of pride; but the Lord's power came over him,
and the rest that were with him.</p>

<p>Another time there came an officer of the army, a
very malicious, bitter professor whom I had known
in London. He was full of his airy talk also, and
spoke slightingly of the Light of Christ, and against
the Truth, and against the Spirit of God being in
men, as it was in the apostles' days; till the power of
God, that bound the evil in him, had almost choked
him as it did Colonel Rouse: for he was so full of
evil that he could not speak, but blubbered and stuttered.
But from the time that the Lord's power
struck him and came over him, he was ever after
more loving to us.</p>

<p>The assizes being over, and we settled in prison
upon such a commitment that we were not likely to
be soon released, we broke off from giving the jailer
seven shillings a week apiece for our horses, and seven
shillings a week for ourselves, and sent our horses
into the country. Upon which he grew very wicked
and devilish, and put us down into Doomsdale, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
nasty, stinking place, where they used to put murderers
after they were condemned.<a name="FNanchor_87_118" id="FNanchor_87_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_118" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>The place was so noisome that it was observed few
that went in did ever come out again in health.
There was no house of office in it; and the excrement
of the prisoners that from time to time had been put
there had not been carried out (as we were told) for
many years. So that it was all like mire, and in some
places to the tops of the shoes in water and urine;
and he would not let us cleanse it, nor suffer us to
have beds or straw to lie on.</p>

<p>At night some friendly people of the town brought
us a candle and a little straw; and we burned a little
of our straw to take away the stink. The thieves
lay over our heads, and the head jailer in a room by
them, over our heads also. It seems the smoke went
up into the room where the jailer lay; which put him
into such a rage that he took the pots of excrement
from the thieves and poured them through a hole
upon our heads in Doomsdale, till we were so bespattered
that we could not touch ourselves nor one another.
And the stink increased upon us; so that
what with stink, and what with smoke, we were almost
choked and smothered. We had the stink under
our feet before, but now we had it on our heads
and backs also; and he having quenched our straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
with the filth he poured down, had made a great
smother in the place. Moreover, he railed at us most
hideously, calling us hatchet-faced dogs, and such
strange names as we had never heard of. In this
manner we were obliged to stand all night, for we
could not sit down, the place was so full of filthy
excrement.</p>

<p>A great while he kept us after this manner before
he would let us cleanse it, or suffer us to have any
victuals brought in but what we got through the
grate. One time a girl brought us a little meat; and
he arrested her for breaking his house, and sued her
in the town-court for breaking the prison. A great
deal of trouble he put the young woman to; whereby
others were so discouraged that we had much ado to
get water, drink, or victuals. Near this time we sent
for a young woman, Ann Downer, from London, who
could write and take things well in short-hand, to
buy and dress our meat for us; which she was very
willing to do, it being also upon her spirit to come to
us in the love of God; and she was very serviceable
to us.</p>

<p>The head-jailer, we were informed, had been a
thief, and was burnt both in the hand and in the
shoulder; his wife, too, had been burnt in the hand.
The under-jailer had been burnt both in the hand
and in the shoulder: his wife had been burnt in the
hand also. Colonel Bennet, a Baptist teacher, having
purchased the jail and lands belonging to the castle,
had placed this head-jailer there. The prisoners
and some wild people would be talking of spirits that
haunted Doomsdale, and how many had died in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
thinking perhaps to terrify us therewith. But I told
them that if all the spirits and devils in hell were
there, I was over them in the power of God, and
feared no such thing; for Christ, our Priest, would
sanctify the walls of the house to us, He who had
bruised the head of the devil.<a name="FNanchor_88_119" id="FNanchor_88_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_119" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The priest was to
cleanse the plague out of the walls of the house under
the law, which had been ended by Christ, our
Priest, who sanctifies both inwardly and outwardly
the walls of the house, the walls of the heart, and all
things to his people.</p>

<p>By this time the general quarter-sessions drew
nigh; and the jailer still carrying himself basely and
wickedly towards us, we drew up our suffering case,
and sent it to the sessions at Bodmin. On the reading
thereof, the justices gave order that Doomsdale
door should be opened, and that we should have liberty
to cleanse it, and to buy our meat in the town.
We also sent a copy of our sufferings to the Protector,
setting forth how we had been taken and committed
by Major Ceely; and abused by Captain Keat
as aforesaid, and the rest in order. The Protector
sent down an order to Captain Fox, governor of
Pendennis Castle, to examine the matter about the
soldiers abusing us, and striking me.</p>

<p>There were at that time many of the gentry of the
country at the Castle; and Captain Keat's kinsman,
that struck me, was sent for before them, and much
threatened. They told him that if I should change
my principles, I might take the extremity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
law against him, and might recover sound damages
of him. Captain Keat also was checked, for suffering
the prisoners under his charge to be abused.</p>

<p>This was of great service in the country; for afterwards
Friends might speak in any market or steeple-house
thereabouts, and none would meddle with
them. I understood that Hugh Peters, one of the
Protector's chaplains, told him they could not do
George Fox a greater service for the spreading of his
principles in Cornwall, than to imprison him there.</p>

<p>And indeed my imprisonment there was of the
Lord, and for His service in those parts; for after the
assizes were over, and it was known that we were
likely to continue prisoners, several Friends from
most parts of the nation came in to the country to
visit us. Those parts of the west were very dark
countries at that time; but the Lord's light and truth
broke forth, shone over all, and many were turned
from darkness to light, and from Satan's power unto
God. Many were moved to go to the steeple-houses;
and several were sent to prison to us; and a great
convincement began in the country. For now we
had liberty to come out, and to walk in the Castle-Green;
and many came to us on First-days, to whom
we declared the Word of life.</p>

<p>Great service we had among them, and many were
turned to God, up and down the country; but great
rage possessed the priests and professors against
the Truth and us. One of the envious professors
had collected many Scripture sentences to
prove that we ought to put off our hats to
the people; and he invited the town of Launceston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to come into the castle-yard to hear him
read them. Amongst other instances that he there
brought, one was that Saul bowed to the witch of
Endor. When he had done, we got a little liberty to
speak; and we showed both him and the people that
Saul was gone from God, and had disobeyed God
when he went to the witch of Endor: that neither the
prophets, nor Christ, nor the apostles ever taught
people to bow to a witch.</p>

<p>Another time, about eleven at night, the jailer,
being half drunk, came and told me that he had got
a man now to dispute with me: (this was when we
had leave to go a little into the town). As soon as
he spoke these words I felt there was mischief intended
to my body. All that night and the next day
I lay down on a grass-plot to slumber, and felt something
still about my body: I started up, and struck
at it in the power of the Lord, and still it was about
my body.</p>

<p>Then I rose and walked into the Castle-Green, and
the under-keeper came and told me that there was a
maid would speak with me in the prison. I felt a
snare in his words, too, therefore I went not into the
prison, but to the grate; and looking in, I saw a man
that was lately brought to prison for being a conjurer,
who had a naked knife in his hand. I spoke to
him, and he threatened to cut my chaps; but, being
within the jail he could not come at me. This was
the jailer's great disputant.</p>

<p>I went soon after into the jailer's house, and found
him at breakfast; he had then got his conjurer out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
with him. I told the jailer his plot was discovered.
Then he got up from the table, and cast his napkin
away in a rage; and I left them, and went to my
chamber; for at this time we were out of Doomsdale.</p>

<p>At the time the jailer had said the dispute should
be, I went down and walked in the court (the place
appointed) till about the eleventh hour; but nobody
came. Then I went up to my chamber again; and
after awhile heard one call for me. I stepped to the
stairshead, where I saw the jailer's wife upon the
stairs, and the conjurer at the bottom of the stairs,
holding his hand behind his back, and in a great rage.</p>

<p>I asked him, "Man, what hast thou in thy hand
behind thy back? Pluck thy hand before thee," said
I; "let's see thy hand, and what thou hast in it."</p>

<p>Then he angrily plucked forth his hand, with a
naked knife in it. I showed the jailer's wife their
wicked design against me; for this was the man they
brought to dispute of the things of God. But the
Lord discovered their plot, and prevented their evil
design; and they both raged, and the conjurer threatened.</p>

<p>Then I was moved of the Lord to speak sharply
to him in the dreadful power of the Lord; and the
Lord's power came over him, and bound him down;
so that he never after durst appear before me, to
speak to me. I saw it was the Lord alone that had
preserved me out of their bloody hands; for the devil
had a great enmity to me, and stirred up his instruments
to seek my hurt. But the Lord prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
them; and my heart was filled with thanksgivings
and praises to him.<a name="FNanchor_89_120" id="FNanchor_89_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_120" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In Cornwall, Devonshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire,
Truth began mightily to spread. Many
were turned to Christ Jesus and His free teaching:
for many Friends that came to visit us were drawn to
declare the Truth in those counties. This made the
priests and professors rage, and they stirred up the
magistrates to ensnare Friends. They set up watches
in the streets and highways, on pretence of taking
up suspicious persons, under which colour they
stopped and took up Friends coming to visit us in
prison; which was done that these Friends might not
pass up and down in the Lord's service.</p>

<p>But that by which they thought to have stopped
the Truth was the means of spreading it so much the
more; for then Friends were frequently moved to
speak to one constable and to another officer, and to
the justices before whom they were brought; which
caused the Truth to spread the more in all their parishes.
And when Friends were got among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
watches, it would be a fortnight or three weeks before
they could get out of them again; for no sooner
had one constable taken and carried them before the
justices, and these had discharged them, but another
would take them up and carry them before other
justices: which put the country to a great deal of
needless trouble and charges.</p>

<p>As Thomas Rawlinson was coming out of the
north to visit us, a constable in Devonshire took him
up, and at night took twenty shillings out of his
pocket: and after being thus robbed he was cast into
Exeter jail. They cast into prison in Devonshire,
under pretence of his being a Jesuit, Henry Pollexfen,
who had been a justice of the peace for almost
forty years. Many Friends were cruelly beaten by
them; nay, some clothiers that were but going to
mill with their cloth, and others about their outward
occasions, they took up and whipped; though men of
about eighty or an hundred pounds by the year, and
not above four or five miles from their families.</p>

<p>The mayor of Launceston took up all he could,
and cast them into prison. He would search substantial,
grave women, their petticoats and their
head-cloths. A young man coming to see us, I drew
up all the gross, inhuman, and unchristian actions of
the mayor, gave it him, and bade him seal it up,
and go out again the back way; and then come into
the town through the gates. He did so, and the
watch took him up and carried him before the
mayor; who presently searched his pockets and
found the letter. Therein he saw all his actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
characterized; which shamed him so that from that
time he meddled little with the Lord's servants.</p>

<p>While I was in prison here, the Baptists and Fifth-monarchy
men prophesied that this year Christ
should come, and reign upon earth a thousand years.
And they looked upon this reign to be outward:
when He was come inwardly in the hearts of His
people, to reign and rule; where these professors
would not receive Him. So they failed in their
prophecy and expectation, and had not the possession
of Him. But Christ is come, and doth dwell and
reign in the hearts of His people.<a name="FNanchor_90_121" id="FNanchor_90_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_121" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Thousands, at
the door of whose hearts He hath been knocking,
have opened to Him, and He is come in, and doth
sup with them, and they with Him; the heavenly
supper with the heavenly and spiritual man. So
many of these Baptists and Monarchy-people turned
the greatest enemies to the followers of Christ;
but He reigns in the hearts of His saints over all
their envy.</p>

<p>At the assize divers justices came to us, and were
pretty civil, and reasoned of the things of God soberly;
expressing a pity to us. Captain Fox, governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of Pendennis Castle, came and looked me in
the face, and said never a word; but went to his company
and told them he never saw a simpler man in
his life. I called after him, and said, "Stay, man;
we will see who is the simpler man." But he went
his way. A light, chaffy person.</p>

<p>Thomas Lower<a name="FNanchor_91_122" id="FNanchor_91_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_122" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> also came to visit us, and offered
us money, which we refused; accepting nevertheless
of his love. He asked us many questions concerning
our denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God;
concerning the sacraments, and such like: to all
which he received satisfaction. I spoke particularly
to him; and he afterwards said my words were as a
flash of lightning, they ran so through him. He said
he had never met with such men in his life, for they
knew the thoughts of his heart; and were as the wise
master-builders of the assemblies that fastened their
words like nails. He came to be convinced of the
truth, and remains a Friend to this day.</p>

<p>When he came home to his aunt Hambley's, where
he then lived, and made report to her concerning us,
she, with her sister Grace Billing, hearing the report
of Truth, came to visit us in prison, and was convinced
also. Great sufferings and spoiling of goods
both he and his aunt have undergone for the Truth's
sake.</p>

<p>After the assizes, the sheriff, with some soldiers,
came to guard to execution a woman that was sentenced
to die; and we had much discourse with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
One of them wickedly said, "Christ was as passionate
a man as any that lived upon the earth;" for
which we rebuked him. Another time we asked the
jailer what doings there were at the sessions; and
he said, "Small matters; only about thirty for bastardy."
We thought it very strange that they who
professed themselves Christians should make small
matters of such things.</p>

<p>But this jailer was very bad himself; I often admonished
him to sobriety; but he abused people that
came to visit us. Edward Pyot had a cheese sent
him from Bristol by his wife; and the jailer took it
from him, and carried it to the mayor, to search it
for treasonable letters, as he said; and though they
found no treason in the cheese, they kept it from
us.<a name="FNanchor_92_123" id="FNanchor_92_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_123" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This jailer might have been rich&mdash;if he had
carried himself civilly; but he sought his own ruin,
which soon after came upon him.</p>

<p>The next year he was turned out of his place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for some wickedness cast into the jail himself; and
there begged of our Friends. And for some unruliness
in his conduct he was, by the succeeding jailer,
put into Doomsdale, locked in irons, and beaten, and
bidden to remember how he had abused those good
men whom he had wickedly, without any cause, cast
into that nasty dungeon; and told that now he deservedly
should suffer for his wickedness; and the
same measure he had meted to others, should be
meted out to himself. He became very poor, and
died in prison; and his wife and family came to
misery.</p>

<p>While I was in prison in Launceston, a Friend went
to Oliver Cromwell, and offered himself, body for
body, to lie in Doomsdale in my stead; if he would
take him, and let me have liberty. Which thing so
struck him, that he said to his great men and council,
"Which of you would do as much for me if I
were in the same condition?" And though he did
not accept of the Friend's offer, but said he could
not do it, for that it was contrary to law, yet the
Truth thereby came mightily over him. A good
while after this he sent down Major-General Desborough,
pretending to set us at liberty. When he
came, he offered us our liberty if we would say we
would go home and preach no more; but we could not
promise him. Then he urged that we should promise
to go home, if the Lord permitted.</p>

<p>After this<a name="FNanchor_93_124" id="FNanchor_93_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_124" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Major-General Desborough came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the Castle-Green, and played at bowls with the justices
and others. Several Friends were moved to go
and admonish them not to spend their time so vainly,
desiring them to consider, that though they professed
themselves to be Christians, yet they gave themselves
up to their pleasures, and kept the servants of God
meanwhile in prison; and telling them that the Lord
would plead with them and visit them for such
things. But notwithstanding what was written or
said to him, he went away, and left us in prison.</p>

<p>We understood afterwards that he left the business
to Colonel Bennet, who had the command of the jail.
For some time after Bennet would have set us at
liberty if we would have paid his jailer's fees. But
we told him we could give the jailer no fees, for we
were innocent sufferers; and how could they expect
fees of us, who had suffered so long wrongfully?
After a while Colonel Bennet coming to town, sent
for us to an inn, and insisted again upon fees, which
we refused. At last the power of the Lord came so
over him, that he freely set us at liberty on the 13th
day of the Seventh month, 1656. We had been prisoners
nine weeks at the first assize, called the Lent-assize,
which was in the spring of the year.</p>

<h3>1656-1657.</h3>


<p>Being released from our imprisonment, we got
horses, rode towards Humphrey Lower's, and met
him upon the road. He told us he was much troubled
in his mind concerning us, and could not rest at
home, but was going to Colonel Bennet to seek our
liberty. When we told him we were set at liberty,
and were going to his house, he was exceeding glad.
To his house we went, and had a fine, precious meeting;
many were convinced, and turned by the Spirit
of the Lord to the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching.</p>

<p>Soon after we came to Exeter, where many
Friends were in prison; and amongst the rest James
Nayler. For a little before we were set at liberty,
James had run out into imaginations, and a company
with him, who raised a great darkness in the nation.
He came to Bristol, and made a disturbance there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_94_125" id="FNanchor_94_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_125" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
From thence he was coming to Launceston to see
me; but was stopped by the way, and imprisoned at
Exeter; as were several others, one of whom, an honest,
tender man, died in prison there. His blood lieth
on the heads of his persecutors.</p>

<p>The night that we came to Exeter I spoke with
James Nayler: for I saw he was out, and wrong, and
so was his company. The next day, being First-day,
we went to visit the prisoners, and had a meeting
with them in the prison; but James Nayler, and some
of them, could not stay the meeting. There came a
corporal of horse into the meeting, who was convinced,
and remained a very good Friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day I spoke to James Nayler again; and
he slighted what I said, was dark, and much out; yet
he would have come and kissed me. But I said that
since he had turned against the power of God, I could
not receive his show of kindness. The Lord moved
me to slight him, and to set the power of God over
him. So after I had been warring with the world,
there was now a wicked spirit risen amongst Friends
to war against. I admonished him and his company.</p>

<p>When he was come to London, his resisting the
power of God in me, and the Truth that was declared
to him by me, became one of his greatest burdens.
But he came to see his out-going, and to condemn
it; and after some time he returned to Truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
again;<a name="FNanchor_95_126" id="FNanchor_95_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_126" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> as in the printed relation of his repentance,
condemnation, and recovery may be more fully seen.</p>

<p>On First-day morning I went to the meeting in
Broadmead at Bristol, which was large and quiet.
Notice was given of a meeting to be in the afternoon
in the orchard.</p>

<p>There was at Bristol a rude Baptist, named Paul
Gwin, who had before made great disturbance in our
meetings, being encouraged and set on by the mayor,
who, it was reported, would sometimes give him his
dinner to encourage him. Such multitudes of rude
people he gathered after him, that it was thought
there had been sometimes ten thousand people at our
meeting in the orchard.</p>

<p>As I was going into the orchard, the people told
me that Paul Gwin was going to the meeting. I bade
them never heed, for it was nothing to me who went
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>When I was come into the orchard, I stood upon
the stone that Friends used to stand on when they
spoke; and I was moved of the Lord to put off my
hat, and to stand a while, and let the people look at
me; for some thousands of people were there. While
I thus stood silent, this rude Baptist began to find
fault with my hair; but I said nothing to him. Then
he ran on into words; and at last, "Ye wise men of
Bristol," said he, "I marvel at you, that you will
stand here, and hear a man speak and affirm that
which he cannot make good."</p>

<p>Then the Lord opened my mouth (for as yet I had
not spoken a word), and I asked the people whether
they had ever heard me speak, or had ever seen me
before; and I bade them take notice what kind of
man this was amongst them that should so impudently
say that I spoke and affirmed that which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
could not make good; and yet neither he nor they
had ever heard me or seen me before. Therefore
that was a lying, envious, malicious spirit that spoke
in him; and it was of the devil, and not of God. I
charged him in the dread and power of the Lord to
be silent: and the mighty power of God came over
him, and all his company.</p>

<p>Then a glorious, peaceable meeting we had, and the
Word of life was divided amongst them; and they
were turned from darkness to the Light,&mdash;to Jesus
their Saviour. The Scriptures were largely opened to
them; and the traditions, rudiments, ways, and doctrines
of men were laid open before the people; and
they were turned to the Light of Christ, that with it
they might see these things, and see Him to lead
them out of them.</p>

<p>I opened also to them the types, figures, and
shadows of Christ in the time of the law; and showed
them that Christ was come, and had ended the types,
shadows, tithes, and oaths, and put down swearing;
and had set up yea and nay instead of it, and a free
ministry. For He was now come to teach the people
Himself, and His heavenly day was springing from
on high.</p>

<p>For many hours did I declare the Word of life
amongst them in the eternal power of God, that by
Him they might come up into the beginning, and be
reconciled to Him. And having turned them to the
Spirit of God in themselves, that would lead into all
Truth, I was moved to pray in the mighty power of
God; and the Lord's power came over all. When I
had done, this fellow began to babble again; and John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Audland was moved to bid him repent, and fear God.
So his own people and followers being ashamed of
him, he passed away, and never came again to disturb
the meeting. The meeting broke up quietly,
and the Lord's power and glory shone over all: a
blessed day it was, and the Lord had the praise.
After a while this Paul Gwin went beyond the seas;
and many years after I met him in Barbadoes.</p>

<p>Soon after we rode to London. When we came
near Hyde Park we saw a great concourse of people,
and, looking towards them, espied the Protector coming
in his coach. Whereupon I rode to his coach
side. Some of his life-guard would have put me
away; but he forbade them. So I rode by his coach
side with him, declaring what the Lord gave me to
say to him, of his condition, and of the sufferings of
Friends in the nation, showing him how contrary this
persecution was to the words of Christ and His apostles,
and to Christianity.</p>

<p>When we were come to James's Park Gate, I left
him; and at parting he desired me to come to his
house. The next day one of his wife's maids, whose
name was Mary Sanders, came to me at my lodging,
and told me that her master came to her, and said he
would tell her some good news. When she asked
him what it was, he told her, "George Fox is come
to town." She replied "That is good news indeed"
(for she had received Truth), but she said she could
hardly believe him till he told her how I met him,
and rode from Hyde Park to James's Park with
him.</p>

<p>After a little time Edward Pyot and I went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Whitehall to see Oliver Cromwell; and when we
came before him, Dr. Owen, vice-chancellor of Oxford,
was with him. We were moved to speak to him
concerning the sufferings of Friends, and laid them
before him: and we directed him to the Light of
Christ, who had enlightened every man that cometh
into the world. He said it was a natural light; but
we showed him the contrary; and proved that it was
divine and spiritual, proceeding from Christ the spiritual
and heavenly man; and that that which was
called the life in Christ the Word, was called the
Light in us.</p>

<p>The power of the Lord God arose in me, and I
was moved in it to bid him lay down his crown at the
feet of Jesus. Several times I spoke to him to the
same effect. I was standing by the table, and he
came and sat upon the table's side by me, saying he
would be as high as I was. So he continued speaking
against the Light of Christ Jesus; and went his way
in a light manner. But the Lord's power came over
him so that when he came to his wife and other company,
he said, "I never parted so from them
before"; for he was judged in himself.</p>

<p>After this I travelled into Yorkshire, and returned
out of Holderness, over Humber, visiting Friends;
and then returning into Leicestershire, Staffordshire,
Worcestershire, and Warwickshire, among Friends,
I had a meeting at Edge-Hill. There came to it
Ranters, Baptists, and several sorts of rude people;
for I had sent word about three weeks before to have
a meeting there, so that hundreds of people were
gathered thither, and many Friends came to it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
afar. The Lord's everlasting Truth and Word of life
reached over all; the rude and unruly spirits were
chained down; and many that day were turned to the
Lord Jesus Christ, by His power and Spirit, and came
to sit under His blessed, free teaching, and to be fed
with His eternal, heavenly food. All was peaceable;
the people passed quietly away, and some of them
said it was a mighty, powerful meeting; for the presence
of the Lord was felt, and His power and Spirit
was amongst them.</p>

<p>Thence I passed to Warwick and to Bagley, having
precious meetings; and then into Gloucestershire,
and so to Oxford, where the scholars were very rude;
but the Lord's power came over them. Great meetings
we had as we travelled up and down.</p>

<p>Thus having travelled over most of the nation, I
returned to London again, having cleared myself of
that which lay upon me from the Lord. For after I
was released out of Launceston jail, I was moved of
the Lord to travel over the nation, the Truth being
now spread in most places, that I might answer, and
remove out of the minds of the people, some objections
which the envious priests and professors had
raised and spread abroad concerning us.</p>

<p>In this year the Lord's Truth was finely planted
over the nation, and many thousands were turned to
the Lord; insomuch that there were seldom fewer
than one thousand in prison in this nation for Truth's
testimony; some for tithes, some for going to the
steeple-houses, some for contempts (as they called
them), some for not swearing, and others for not putting
off their hats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Having stayed some time in London, and visited
the meetings of Friends in and about the city, and
cleared myself of what services the Lord had at that
time laid upon me there, I left the town and travelled
into Kent, Sussex, and Surrey, visiting Friends. I
had great meetings, and often met with opposition
from Baptists and other jangling professors; but the
Lord's power went over them.</p>

<p>We lay one night at Farnham, where we had a little
meeting. The people were exceeding rude; but
at last the Lord's power came over them. After
meeting we went to our inn, and gave notice that any
who feared God might come to our inn to us. There
came abundance of rude people, the magistrates of
the town, and some professors. I declared the Truth
to them; and those people that behaved themselves
rudely, the magistrates put out of the room.</p>

<p>When they were gone, another rude company of
professors came up, and some of the chief of the
town. They called for faggots and drink, though we
forbade them, and were as rude a people as ever I
met. The Lord's power chained them, that they had
not power to do us any mischief; but when they went
away they left all the faggots and beer, for which
they had called, in the room, for us to pay for in the
morning. We showed the innkeeper what an unworthy
thing it was; but he told us we must pay it;
and pay it we did.</p>

<p>Before we left the town I wrote to the magistrates
and heads of the town, and to the priest, showing
them how he had taught his people, and laying before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
them their rude and uncivil carriage to strangers that
sought their good.</p>

<p>Leaving that place we came to Basingstoke, a very
rude town; where they had formerly very much
abused Friends. There I had a meeting in the evening,
which was quiet; for the Lord's power chained
the unruly. At the close of the meeting I was moved
to put off my hat and to pray to the Lord to open
their understandings; upon which they raised a
report that I put off my hat to them and bade them
good night, which was never in my heart.</p>

<p>After the meeting, when we came to our inn, I
sent for the innkeeper, as I was used to do; and he
came into the room to us, and showed himself a very
rude man. I admonished him to be sober, and fear
the Lord; but he called for faggots and a pint of
wine, and drank it off himself; then called for another,
and called up half a dozen men into our chamber.
Thereupon I bade him go out of the chamber,
and told him he should not drink there; for we called
him up to speak to him concerning his eternal good.</p>

<p>He was exceeding mad, rude, and drunk. When
he continued his rudeness and would not be gone, I
told him that the chamber was mine for the time I
lodged in it; and called for the key. Then he went
away in a rage. In the morning he would not be
seen; but I told his wife of his unchristian carriage
towards us.</p>

<p>We then travelled to Exeter; and at the sign of the
Seven Stars, an inn at the bridge foot, had a general
meeting of Friends out of Cornwall and Devonshire;
to which came Humphrey Lower, Thomas Lower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and John Ellis from the Land's End; Henry Pollexfen,
and Friends from Plymouth; Elizabeth Trelawny,
and divers other Friends. A blessed heavenly
meeting we had, and the Lord's everlasting power
came over all, in which I saw and said that the Lord's
power had surrounded this nation round about as
with a wall and bulwark, and His seed reached from
sea to sea. Friends were established in the everlasting
Seed of life, Christ Jesus, their Life, Rock,
Teacher, and Shepherd.</p>

<p>Next morning Major Blackmore sent soldiers to
apprehend me; but I was gone before they came. As
I was riding up the street I saw the officers going
down; so the Lord crossed them in their design, and
Friends passed away peaceably and quietly. The soldiers
examined some Friends after I was gone, asking
them what they did there; but when they told them
that they were in their inn, and had business in the
city, they went away without meddling any further
with them.</p>

<p>We passed through the countries,<a name="FNanchor_AF_127" id="FNanchor_AF_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_127" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> having meetings,
and gathering people in the name of Christ,
their heavenly teacher, till we came to Brecknock,
where we put up our horses at an inn. There went
with me Thomas Holmes and John ap-John, who was
moved of the Lord to speak in the streets. I walked
out but a little into the fields; and when I returned
the town was in an uproar. When I came into the
chamber in the inn, it was full of people, and they
were speaking in Welsh. I desired them to speak in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
English, which they did; and much discourse we had.
After a while they went away.</p>

<p>Towards night the magistrates gathered in the
streets with a multitude of people, and they bade
them shout, and gathered up the town; so that, for
about two hours together, there was a noise the
like of which we had not heard; and the magistrates
set them on to shout again when they had given over.
We thought it looked like the uproar amongst
Diana's craftsmen. This tumult continued till night,
and if the Lord's power had not limited them, they
would likely have pulled down the house, and torn
us to pieces.</p>

<p>At night the woman of the house would have had
us go to supper in another room; but we, discerning
her plot, refused. Then she would have had half a
dozen men come into the room to us, under the pretence
of discoursing with us. We told her, "No person
shall come into our room this night, neither will
we go to them." Then she said we should sup in
another room; but we told her we would have no
supper if we had it not in our own room. At length,
when she saw she could not get us out, she brought
up our supper.</p>

<p>So she and they were crossed in their design; for
they had an intent to do us mischief, but the Lord
prevented them. Next morning I wrote a paper to
the town concerning their unchristian carriage, showing
the fruits of their priests and magistrates; and as
I passed out of town I spoke to the people, and told
them they were a shame to Christianity and religion.</p>

<p>After this we returned to England, and came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Shrewsbury, where we had a great meeting, and
visited Friends all over the countries in their meetings,
till we came to William Gandy's, in Cheshire,
where we had a meeting of between two and three
thousand people, as it was thought; and the everlasting
Word of life was held forth, and received that
day. A blessed meeting it was, for Friends were settled
by the power of God upon Christ Jesus, the
Rock and Foundation.</p>

<p>At this time there was a great drought; and after
this general meeting was ended, there fell so great a
rain that Friends said they thought we could not
travel, the waters would be so risen. But I believed
the rain had not extended as far as they had come
that day to the meeting. Next day, in the afternoon,
when we turned back into some parts of Wales again,
the roads were dusty, and no rain had fallen there.</p>

<p>When Oliver Cromwell sent forth a proclamation
for a fast throughout the nation, for rain, when there
was a very great drought, it was observed that as far
as Truth had spread in the north, there were pleasant
showers and rain enough, while in the south, in many
places, the fields were almost spoiled for want of
rain. At that time I was moved to write an answer
to the Protector's proclamation, wherein I told him
that if he had come to own God's Truth, he should
have had rain; and that the drought was a sign unto
them of their barrenness, and their want of the
water of life.</p>

<p>We passed through Montgomeryshire into Wales,
and so into Radnorshire, where there was a meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
like a leaguer,<a name="FNanchor_AG_128" id="FNanchor_AG_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_128" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> for multitudes. I walked a little aside
whilst the people were gathering: and there came to
me John ap-John, a Welshman, whom I asked to go
to the people; and if he had anything upon him from
the Lord to them, he might speak in Welsh, and
thereby gather more together. Then came Morgan
Watkins to me, who was become loving to Friends,
and said, "The people lie like a leaguer, and the gentry
of the country are come in." I bade him go up
also, and leave me; for I had a great travail upon me
for the salvation of the people.</p>

<p>When they were well gathered, I went into the
meeting, and stood upon a chair about three hours. I
stood a pretty while before I began to speak. After
some time I felt the power of the Lord over the
whole assembly: and His everlasting life and Truth
shone over all. The Scriptures were opened to them,
and the objections they had in their minds answered.
They were directed to the Light of Christ, the heavenly
man; that by it they might see their sins, and
Christ Jesus to be their Saviour, their Redeemer,
their Mediator; and come to feed upon Him, the
bread of life from heaven.</p>

<p>Many were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to
His free teaching that day; and all were bowed down
under the power of God; so that though the multitude
was so great that many sat on horseback to hear,
there was no opposition. A priest sat with his wife
on horseback, heard attentively, and made no objection.</p>

<p>The people parted peaceably, with great satisfaction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
many of them saying they had never heard
such a sermon before, nor the Scriptures so opened.
For the new covenant was opened, and the old, and
the nature and terms of each; and the parables were
explained. The state of the Church in the apostles'
days was set forth, and the apostasy since was laid
open; the free teaching of Christ and the apostles
was set atop of all the hireling teachers; and the Lord
had the praise of all, for many were turned to Him
that day.<a name="FNanchor_96_129" id="FNanchor_96_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_129" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>I went thence to Leominster, where was a great
meeting in a close, many hundreds of people being
gathered together. There were about six congregational
preachers and priests amongst the people; and
Thomas Taylor, who had been a priest, but was now
become a minister of Christ Jesus, was with me. I
stood up and declared about three hours; and none
of the priests were able to open their mouths in opposition;
the Lord's power and Truth so reached and
bound them.</p>

<p>At length one priest went off about a bow-shot
from me, drew several of the people after him, and
began to preach to them. So I kept our meeting,
and he kept his. After awhile Thomas Taylor was
moved to go and speak to him, upon which he gave
over: and he, with the people he had drawn off, came
to us again; and the Lord's power went over all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>From this place I travelled on in Wales, having
several meetings, till I came to Tenby, where, as I
rode up the street, a justice of the peace came out
to me, asked me to alight, and desired that I would
stay at his house, which I did. On First-day the
mayor, with his wife, and several others of the chief
people of the town, came in about the tenth hour,
and stayed all the time of the meeting. A glorious
meeting it was.</p>

<p>John ap-John being then with me, left the meeting,
and went to the steeple-house; and the governor cast
him into prison. On Second-day morning the governor
sent one of his officers to the justice's to fetch
me; which grieved the mayor and the justice; for
they were both with me in the justice's house when
the officer came. The mayor and the justice went to
the governor before me; and awhile after I went with
the officer. When I came in I said, "Peace be unto
this house," and before the governor could examine
me I asked him why he cast my friend into prison.
He said, "For standing with his hat on in the
church."</p>

<p>I said, "Had not the priest two caps on his head,
a black one and a white one? Cut off the brims of
the hat, and then my friend would have but one:
and the brims of the hat were but to defend him from
weather."</p>

<p>"These are frivolous things," said the governor.</p>

<p>"Why, then," said I, "dost thou cast my friend
into prison for such frivolous things?"</p>

<p>He asked me whether I owned election and reprobation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
"Yes," said I, "and thou art in the reprobation."</p>

<p>At that he was in a rage and said he would send
me to prison till I proved it. I told him I would
prove that quickly if he would confess Truth. I
asked him whether wrath, fury, rage and persecution
were not marks of reprobation; for he that was
born of the flesh persecuted him that was born of the
Spirit; but Christ and His disciples never persecuted
nor imprisoned any.</p>

<p>He fairly confessed that he had too much wrath,
haste and passion in him. I told him that Esau was
up in him, the first birth; not Jacob, the second birth.
The Lord's power so reached the man and came over
him that he confessed to Truth; and the other justice
came and shook me kindly by the hand.</p>

<p>As I was passing away I was moved to speak to the
governor again; and he invited me to dinner with
him, and set my friend at liberty. I went back to
the other justice's house; and after some time the
mayor and his wife, and the justice and his wife, and
divers other Friends of the town, went about half a
mile out of town with us, to the water-side, when
we went away; and there, when we parted from them,
I was moved of the Lord to kneel down with them,
and pray to the Lord to preserve them. So, after I
had recommended them to the Lord Jesus Christ,
their Saviour and free Teacher, we passed away in the
Lord's power; and He had the glory.</p>

<p>We travelled to Pembrokeshire, and in Pembroke
had some service for the Lord. Thence we passed
to Haverford West, where we had a great meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and all was quiet. The Lord's power came over all,
and many were settled in the new covenant, Christ
Jesus, and built upon Him, their Rock and Foundation;
and they stand a precious meeting to this day.
Next day, being their fair-day, we passed through it,
and sounded the day of the Lord, and His everlasting
Truth, amongst them.</p>

<p>After this we passed into another county, and at
noon came into a great market-town, and went into
several inns before we could get any meat for our
horses. At last we came to one where we got some.
Then John ap-John being with me, went and spoke
through the town, declaring the Truth to the people;
and when he came to me again, he said he thought
all the town were as people asleep. After awhile he
was moved to go and declare Truth in the streets
again; then the town was all in an uproar, and they
cast him into prison.</p>

<p>Presently after several of the chief people of the
town came, with others, to the inn where I was, and
said, "They have cast your man into prison."</p>

<p>"For what?" said I.</p>

<p>"He preached in our streets," said they.</p>

<p>Then I asked them, "What did he say? Had he
reproved some of the drunkards and swearers, and
warned them to repent, and leave off their evil doings,
and turn to the Lord?" I asked them who cast
him into prison. They said, the high-sheriff and justices,
and the mayor. I asked their names, and
whether they understood themselves; and whether
that was their conduct to travellers that passed
through their town, and strangers that admonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and exhorted them to fear the Lord, and reproved
sin in their gates.</p>

<p>These went back, and told the officers what I had
said; and after awhile they brought down John ap-John,
guarded with halberts, in order to put him out
of the town. Being at the inn door, I bade the officers
take their hands off him. They said that the
mayor and justices had commanded them to put him
out of town. I told them I would talk with their
mayor and justices concerning their uncivil and unchristian
carriage towards him.</p>

<p>So I spoke to John to go look after the horses, and
get them ready, and charged the officers not to touch
him. After I had declared the Truth to them, and
showed them the fruits of their priests, and their incivility
and unchristian carriage, they left us. They
were a kind of Independents; a very wicked town,
and false. We bade the innkeeper give our horses
a peck of oats; and no sooner had we turned our
backs than the oats were stolen from our horses.</p>

<p>After we had refreshed ourselves a little, and were
ready, we took horse, and rode up to the inn, where
the mayor, sheriff, and justices were. I called to
speak with them, and asked them why they had imprisoned
John ap-John, and kept him in prison two or
three hours. But they would not answer me a word;
they only looked out at the windows upon me. So
I showed them how unchristian was their carriage
to strangers and travellers, and how it manifested the
fruits of their teachers; and I declared the truth unto
them, and warned them of the day of the Lord, that
was coming upon all evil-doers; and the Lord's power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
came over them, that they looked ashamed; but not
a word could I get from them in answer.</p>

<p>So when I had warned them to repent, and turn to
the Lord, we passed away. At night we came to a
little inn, very poor, but very cheap; for our own
provision and that for our two horses cost but eight-pence;
but the horses would not eat their oats. We
declared the Truth to the people of the place, and
sounded the day of the Lord through the countries.<a name="FNanchor_AH_130" id="FNanchor_AH_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_130" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a></p>

<p>Passing thence we came to a great town, and went
to an inn. Edward Edwards went into the market,
and declared the Truth amongst the people; and they
followed him to the inn, and filled the yard, and were
exceedingly rude. Yet good service we had for the
Lord amongst them; for the life of Christianity and
the power of it tormented their chaffy spirits, and
came over them, so that some were reached and convinced;
and the Lord's power came over all. The
magistrates were bound; they had no power to meddle
with us.</p>

<p>After this we came to another great town on a
market-day; and John ap-John declared the everlasting
Truth through the streets, and proclaimed the
day of the Lord amongst them. In the evening many
people gathered about the inn; and some of them,
being drunk, would fain have had us come into the
street again. But seeing their design, I told them
that if there were any that feared God and desired
to hear the Truth, they might come into our inn; or
else we might have a meeting with them next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Some service for the Lord we had amongst them,
both over night and in the morning; and though the
people were slow to receive the Truth, yet the seed
was sown; and thereabouts the Lord hath a people
gathered to Himself.</p>

<p>In that inn, also, I but turned my back to the man
that was giving oats to my horse, and, looking round
again, I observed he was filling his pockets with the
provender. A wicked, thievish people, to rob the
poor, dumb creature of his food. I would rather
they had robbed me.</p>

<p>Thence we went to Beaumaris, a town wherein
John ap-John had formerly been a preacher. After
we had put up our horses at an inn, John went and
spoke through the street; and there being a garrison
in the town, they took him and put him into prison.
The innkeeper's wife came and told me that the governor
and magistrates were sending for me, to commit
me to prison also. I told her that they had done
more than they could answer already; and had acted
contrary to Christianity in imprisoning him for reproving
sin in their streets and gates, and for declaring
the Truth. Soon after came other friendly people,
and told me that if I went into the street, the
governor and magistrates would imprison me also;
therefore they desired me to keep within the inn.</p>

<p>Upon this I was moved to go and walk up and
down in the streets.<a name="FNanchor_97_131" id="FNanchor_97_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_131" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And I told the people what an
uncivil, unchristian thing they had done in casting
my friend into prison. And they being high professors,
I asked them if this was the entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
they had for strangers; if they would willingly be
so served themselves; and whether they, who looked
upon the Scriptures to be their rule, had any example
in the Scriptures from Christ or His apostles,
for what they had done. So after awhile they set
John ap-John at liberty.</p>

<p>Next day, being market-day, we were to cross a
great water;<a name="FNanchor_98_132" id="FNanchor_98_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_132" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and not far from the place where we
were to take boat, many of the market-people drew
to us. Amongst these we had good service for the
Lord, declaring the Word of Life and everlasting
Truth unto them, proclaiming amongst them the day
of the Lord, which was coming upon all wickedness;
and directing them to the Light of Christ, with which
He, the heavenly man, had enlightened them; by
which they might see all their sins, and all their false
ways, religions, worships and teachers; and by the
same Light might see Christ Jesus, who was come to
save them, and lead them to God.</p>

<p>After the Truth had been declared to them in the
power of God, and Christ the free teacher set over
all the hireling teachers, I made John ap-John get his
horse into the boat, which was then ready. But
there being a company of wild "gentlemen," as they
were called, gotten into it (whom we found very
rude, and far from gentleness), they, with others,
kept his horse out of the boat. I rode to the boat's
side, and spoke to them, showing them what an unmanly
and unchristian carriage it was; and told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
that they showed an unworthy spirit, below Christianity
or humanity.</p>

<p>As I spoke, I leaped my horse into the boat
amongst them, thinking John's horse would follow
when he had seen mine go in before him. But the
water being pretty deep, John could not get his horse
into the boat. Therefore I leaped out again on horseback
into the water, and stayed with John on that
side till the boat returned.</p>

<p>There we tarried, from the eleventh hour of the
forenoon to the second in the afternoon, before the
boat came to fetch us; and then had forty-two miles
to ride that evening; and by the time we had paid
for our passage, we had but one groat left between
us in money.</p>

<p>We rode about sixteen miles, and then got a little
hay for our horses. Setting forward again, we came
in the night to a little ale-house, where we thought
to have stayed and baited. But, finding we could
have neither oats nor hay there, we travelled all
night; and about the fifth hour in the morning got to
a place within six miles of Wrexham, where that day
we met with many Friends, and had a glorious meeting.
The Lord's everlasting power and Truth was
over all; and a meeting is continued there to this day.</p>

<p>Next day we passed thence into Flintshire, sounding
the day of the Lord through the towns; and came
into Wrexham at night. Here many of Floyd's people
came to us; but very rude, wild, and airy they
were, and little sense of truth they had; yet some
were convinced in that town. Next morning one
called a lady sent for me, who kept a preacher in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
her house. I went, but found both her and her
preacher very light and airy; too light to receive the
weighty things of God. In her lightness she came
and asked me if she should cut my hair; but I was
moved to reprove her, and bade her cut down the corruptions
in herself with the sword of the Spirit of
God. So after I had admonished her to be more
grave and sober, we passed away; and afterwards, in
her frothy mind, she made her boast that she came
behind me and cut off the curl of my hair;<a name="FNanchor_99_133" id="FNanchor_99_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_133" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> but she
spoke falsely.</p>

<p>From Wrexham we came to Chester; and it being
the fair time, we stayed a while, and visited Friends.
For I had travelled through every county in Wales,
preaching the everlasting gospel of Christ; and a
brave people there is now, who have received it, and
sit under Christ's teaching. But before I left Wales
I wrote to the magistrates of Beaumaris concerning
the imprisoning of John ap-John; letting them see
their conditions, and the fruits of their Christianity,
and of their teachers. Afterwards I met with some
of them near London; but, oh, how ashamed they
were of their action!</p>

<p>Soon we came to Manchester, and the sessions
being there that day many rude people were come
out of the country. In the meeting they threw at me
coals, clods, stones, and water; yet the Lord's power
bore me up over them that they could not strike me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
down. At last, when they saw they could not prevail
by throwing water, stones, and dirt at me, they went
and informed the justices in the sessions, who thereupon
sent officers to fetch me before them.</p>

<p>The officers came in while I was declaring the
Word of life to the people, plucked me down, and
haled me into their court. When I came there all
the court was in a disorder and a noise. I asked,
"Where are the magistrates that they do not keep
the people civil?" Some of the justices said that
they were magistrates. I asked them why, then,
they did not appease the people, and keep them sober,
for one cried, "I'll swear," and another cried, "I'll
swear."</p>

<p>I declared to the justices how we were abused in
our meeting by the rude people, who threw stones,
clods, dirt, and water; and how I was haled out of
the meeting and brought thither, contrary to the instrument
of government, which said that none should
be molested in their meetings that professed God,
and owned the Lord Jesus Christ; which I did. The
Truth so came over them that when one of the rude
followers cried, "I'll swear," one of the justices
checked him, saying "What will you swear? hold
your tongue."</p>

<p>At last they bade the constable take me to my
lodging, and there secure me till they sent for me
again to-morrow morning. So the constable took me
to my lodging.</p>

<p>As we went the people were exceedingly rude; but
I let them see the fruits of their teachers, how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
shamed Christianity, and dishonored the name of
Jesus which they professed.</p>

<p>At night we went to see a justice in the town who
was pretty moderate, and I had a great deal of discourse
with him. Next morning we sent to the constable
to know if he had anything more to say to us.
He sent us word that he had nothing to say to us; we
might go whither we would.</p>

<p>The Lord hath since raised up a people to stand for
His name and Truth in that town over those chaffy
professors.</p>

<p>We passed from Manchester, having many precious
meetings in several places, till we came to Preston.
Between Preston and Lancaster I had a general
meeting, from which I went to Lancaster. There
at our inn I met with Colonel West, who was very
glad to see me, and meeting with Judge Fell he told
him that I was mightily grown in the Truth; when,
indeed, he was come nearer to the Truth, and so
could better discern it.</p>

<p>We came from Lancaster to Robert Widders's. On
the First-day after I had a general meeting of
Friends of Westmoreland and Lancashire near Sandside,
when the Lord's everlasting power was over all.
In this meeting the Word of eternal life was declared,
and Friends were settled upon the foundation
Christ Jesus, under His free teaching; and many
were convinced, and turned to the Lord.</p>

<p>Next day I came over the Sands to Swarthmore,
where Friends were glad to see me. I stayed there
two First-days, visiting Friends in their meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
thereabouts. They rejoiced with me in the goodness
of the Lord, who by His eternal power had carried
me through and over many difficulties and dangers in
His service; to Him be the praise for ever!</p>

<p>After I had tarried two First-days at Swarthmore,<a name="FNanchor_100_134" id="FNanchor_100_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_134" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and had visited Friends in their meetings
thereabouts, I passed into Westmoreland, in the same
work, till I came to John Audland's, where there was
a general meeting.</p>

<p>The night before I had had a vision of a desperate
creature that was coming to destroy me, but I got victory
over it. And next day in meeting-time came one
Otway, with some rude fellows. He rode round
about the meeting with his sword or rapier, and
would fain have got in through the Friends to me;
but the meeting being great, the Friends stood close,
so that he could not easily come at me. When he
had ridden about several times raging, and found he
could not get in, being limited by the Lord's power,
he went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a glorious meeting, ended peaceably, and
the Lord's everlasting power came over all. This
wild man went home, became distracted, and not long
after died. I sent a paper to John Blakelin to read
to him, while he lay ill, showing him his wickedness,
and he acknowledged something of it.</p>

<p>I had for some time felt drawings on my spirit to
go into Scotland, and had sent to Colonel William
Osburn of Scotland, desiring him to meet me; and he,
with some others, came out of Scotland to this meeting.<a name="FNanchor_101_135" id="FNanchor_101_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_135" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
After it was over (which, he said, was the most
glorious meeting that ever he saw in his life), I
passed with him and his company into Scotland, having
with me Robert Widders, a thundering man
against hypocrisy, deceit, and the rottenness of the
priests.</p>

<p>The first night we came into Scotland we lodged
at an inn. The innkeeper told us an earl lived about
a quarter of a mile off, who had a desire to see me;
and had left word at the inn that if ever I came into
Scotland, he should be told of it. The innkeeper told
us there were three drawbridges to the earl's house;
and that it would be nine o'clock before the third
bridge was drawn.</p>

<p>Finding we had time in the evening, we walked to
his house. He received us very lovingly, and said he
would have gone with us on our journey, but that he
was before engaged to go to a funeral. After we had
spent some time with him, we parted very friendly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and returned to our inn. Next morning we travelled
on, and passing through Dumfries, came to Douglas,
where we met with some Friends. Thence we passed
to the Heads, where we had a blessed meeting in the
name of Jesus, and felt Him in the midst.</p>

<p>Leaving Heads, we went to Badcow, and had a
meeting there, to which abundance of people came,
and many were convinced. Amongst them was one
called a lady. From thence we passed towards the
Highlands to William Osburn's, where we gathered
up the sufferings of Friends, and the principles of the
Scotch priests, which may be seen in a book called
"The Scotch Priests' Principles."</p>

<p>Afterwards we returned to Heads, Badcow, and
Garshore, where the said lady, Margaret Hambleton,
was convinced; who afterwards went to warn Oliver
Cromwell and Charles Fleetwood of the day of the
Lord that was coming upon them.</p>

<p>On First-day we had a great meeting, and several
professors came to it. Now, the priests had frightened
the people with the doctrine of election and
reprobation, telling them that God had ordained the
greatest part of men and women for hell; and that,
let them pray, or preach, or sing, or do what they
would, it was all to no purpose, if they were ordained
for hell. Also that God had a certain number
elected for heaven, let them do what they would; as
David was an adulterer, and Paul a persecutor, yet
still they were elected vessels for heaven. So the
priests said the fault was not at all in the creature,
less or more, but that God had ordained it so.</p>

<p>I was led to open to the people the falseness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
folly of their priests' doctrines, and showed how they,
the priests, had abused those Scriptures they quoted.
Now all that believe in the Light of Christ, as He
commands, are in the election, and sit under the
teaching of the grace of God, which brings their salvation.
But such as turn this grace into wantonness,
are in the reprobation; and such as hate the Light,
are in the condemnation.</p>

<p>So I exhorted all the people to believe in the Light,
as Christ commands, and to own the grace of God,
their free teacher; and it would assuredly bring them
their salvation; for it is sufficient. Many Scriptures
were opened concerning reprobation,<a name="FNanchor_102_136" id="FNanchor_102_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_136" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and the eyes
of the people were opened; and a spring of life rose
up among them.</p>

<p>These things soon came to the priest's ears; for the
people that sat under their dark teachings began to
see light, and to come into the covenant of light.
The noise was spread over Scotland, amongst the
priests, that I was come thither; and a great cry
went up among them that all would be spoiled; for,
they said, I had spoiled all the honest men and
women in England already; so, according to their
own account, the worst were left to them.</p>

<p>Upon this they gathered great assemblies of priests
together, and drew up a number of curses to be read
in their several steeple-houses, that all the people
might say "Amen" to them. Some few of these I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
will here set down; the rest may be read in the book
before mentioned, of "The Scotch Priests' Principles."</p>

<p>The first was, "Cursed is he that saith, Every man
hath a light within him sufficient to lead him to salvation;
and let all the people say, Amen."</p>

<p>The second, "Cursed is he that saith, Faith is
without sin; and let all the people say, Amen."</p>

<p>The third, "Cursed is he that denieth the Sabbath-day;
and let all the people say, Amen."</p>

<p>In this last they make the people curse themselves;
for on the Sabbath-day (which is the seventh day of
the week, which the Jews kept by the command of
God to them) they kept markets and fairs, and so
brought the curse upon their own heads.<a name="FNanchor_103_137" id="FNanchor_103_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_137" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Now were the priests in such a rage that they
posted to Edinburgh to Oliver Cromwell's Council
there, with petitions against me. The noise was that
"all was gone"; for several Friends were come out
of England and spread over Scotland, sounding the
day of the Lord, preaching the everlasting gospel of
salvation, and turning people to Christ Jesus, who
died for them, that they might receive His free
teaching.</p>

<p>After I had gathered the principles of the Scotch
priests, and the sufferings of Friends, and had seen
the Friends, in that part of Scotland settled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Lord's power, upon Christ their foundation, I went
to Edinburgh, and in the way came to Linlithgow,
where lodging at an inn, the innkeeper's wife, who
was blind, received the Word of life, and came under
the teaching of Christ Jesus, her Saviour.</p>

<p>At night there came in abundance of soldiers and
some officers, with whom we had much discourse; and
some were rude. One of the officers said he would
obey the Turk's or Pilate's command, if they should
command him to guard Christ to crucify Him. So
far was he from all tenderness, or sense of the Spirit
of Christ, that he would rather crucify the just than
suffer for or with them; whereas many officers and
magistrates have lost their places before they would
turn against the Lord and His Just One.</p>

<p>When I had stayed a while at Edinburgh, I went to
Leith, where many officers of the army came in with
their wives, and many were convinced. Among these
Edward Billings's wife was one. She brought a great
deal of coral in her hand, and threw it on the table
before me, to see whether I would speak against it
or not. I took no notice of it, but declared the Truth
to her, and she was reached. There came in many
Baptists, who were very rude; but the Lord's power
came over them, so that they went away confounded.</p>

<p>Then there came in another sort, and one of them
said he would dispute with me; and for argument's
sake would deny there was a God. I told him he
might be one of those fools that said in his heart,
"There is no God," but he would know Him in the
day of His judgment. So he went his way.</p>

<p>A precious time we had afterwards with several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
people of account; and the Lord's power came over
all. William Osburn was with me. Colonel Lidcot's
wife, and William Welch's wife, and several of the
officers themselves, were convinced. Edward Billings
and his wife at that time lived apart; and she being
reached by Truth, and become loving to Friends, we
sent for her husband, who came. The Lord's power
reached unto them both, and they joined in it, and
agreed to live together in love and unity as man and
wife.</p>

<p>After this we returned to Edinburgh where many
thousands were gathered together, with abundance
of priests among them, about burning a witch, and I
was moved to declare the day of the Lord amongst
them. When I had done, I went thence to our meeting,
whither came many rude people and Baptists.</p>

<p>The Baptists began to vaunt with their logic and
syllogisms; but I was moved in the Lord's power to
thresh their chaffy, light minds. I showed the people
that, after that fallacious way of discoursing,
they might make white seem black, and black seem
white; as, that because a cock had two legs, and each
of them had two legs, therefore they were all cocks.<a name="FNanchor_104_138" id="FNanchor_104_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_138" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Thus they might turn anything into lightness and
vanity; but it was not the way of Christ, or His apostles,
to teach, speak, or reason after that manner.</p>

<p>Hereupon those Baptists went their way; and after
they were gone we had a blessed meeting in the
Lord's power, which was over all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>I mentioned before that many of the Scotch
priests, being greatly disturbed at the spreading of
Truth, and the loss of their hearers thereby, were
gone to Edinburgh to petition the Council against me.
When I came from the meeting to the inn where I
lodged, an officer belonging to the Council brought
me the following order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thursday, the 8th of October, 1657, at his Highness'
Council in Scotland:</p>

<p>"Ordered, That George Fox do appear before the
Council on Tuesday, the 13th of October next, in the
forenoon.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">E. Downing</span>, Clerk of the Council."
</p></blockquote>

<p>When he had delivered me the order, he asked me
whether I would appear or not. I did not tell him;
but asked him if he had not forged the order. He
said "No"; that it was a real order from the Council,
and he was sent as their messenger with it.</p>

<p>When the time came I appeared, and was taken
into a great room, where many persons came and
looked at me. After awhile the doorkeeper took me
into the council-chamber; and as I was going he took
off my hat. I asked him why he did so, and who was
there that I might not go in with my hat on. I told
him I had been before the Protector with my hat on.
But he hung up my hat and took me in before them.</p>

<p>When I had stood awhile, and they said nothing
to me, I was moved of the Lord to say, "Peace be
amongst you. Wait in the fear of God, that ye may
receive His wisdom from above, by which all things
were made and created; that by it ye may all be ordered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and may order all things under your hands to
God's glory."</p>

<p>They asked me what was the occasion of my coming
into that nation. I told them I came to visit the
Seed of God, which had long lain in bondage under
corruption, so that all in the nation who professed the
Scriptures, the words of Christ, of the prophets and
apostles, might come to the light, Spirit and power,
which they were in who gave them forth. I told
them that in and by the Spirit they might understand
the Scriptures, and know Christ and God aright, and
might have fellowship with them, and one with another.</p>

<p>They asked me whether I had any outward business
there. I said, "Nay." Then they asked me
how long I intended to stay in that country. I told
them I should say little to that; my time was not to
be long; yet in my freedom in the Lord I stood, in
the will of Him that sent me.</p>

<p>Then they bade me withdraw, and the doorkeeper
took me by the hand and led me forth. In a little
time they sent for me again, and told me that I must
depart the nation of Scotland by that day sevennight.
I asked them, "Why? What have I done? What
is my transgression that you pass such a sentence
upon me to depart out of the nation?" They told
me they would not dispute with me. I desired them
to hear what I had to say to them. They said they
would not hear me. I told them, "Pharaoh heard
Moses and Aaron, yet he was an heathen; and Herod
heard John the Baptist; and you should not be worse
than these." But they cried, "Withdraw, withdraw."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Thereupon the doorkeeper took me again
by the hand and led me out.</p>

<p>I returned to my inn, and continued still in Edinburgh;
visiting Friends there and thereabouts, and
strengthening them in the Lord. After a little time
I wrote a letter to the Council to lay before them
their unchristian dealings in banishing me, an innocent
man, that sought their salvation and eternal
good.</p>

<p>After I had spent some time among Friends at
Edinburgh and thereabouts, I passed thence to Heads
again, where Friends had been in great sufferings.
For the Presbyterian priests had excommunicated
them, and given charge that none should buy or sell
or eat or drink with them. So they could neither
sell their commodities nor buy what they wanted;
which made it go very hard with some of them; for
if they had bought bread or other victuals of any of
their neighbors, the priests threatened them so with
curses that they would run and fetch it from them
again. But Colonel Ashfield, being a justice of the
peace in that country, put a stop to the priests' proceedings.
This Colonel Ashfield was afterwards convinced
himself, had a meeting settled at his house,
declared the Truth, and lived and died in it.</p>

<p>After I had visited Friends at and about Heads,
and encouraged them in the Lord, I went to Glasgow,
where a meeting was appointed; but not one of the
town came to it. As I went into the city, the guard
at the gates took me before the governor, who was a
moderate man. A great deal of discourse I had with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
him. He was too light to receive the Truth; yet he
set me at liberty; so I passed to the meeting.</p>

<p>Seeing none of the town's people came to the meeting,
we declared Truth through the town; then passed
away, visited Friends' meetings thereabouts, and returned
towards Badcow. Several Friends declared
Truth in the steeple-houses and the Lord's power was
with them.</p>

<p>Once as I was going with William Osburn to his
house there lay a company of rude fellows by the
wayside, hid under the hedges and in bushes. Seeing
them, I asked him what they were. "Oh," said he,
"they are thieves." Robert Widders, being moved to
go and speak to a priest, was left behind, intending
to come after. So I said to William Osburn, "I will
stay here in this valley, and do thou go and look after
Robert Widders"; but he was unwilling to go, being
afraid to leave me there alone, because of those fellows,
till I told him I feared them not.</p>

<p>Then I called to them, asking them what they lay
lurking there for, and I bade them come to me; but
they were loath to come. I charged them to come
up to me, or else it might be worse with them; then
they came trembling, for the dread of the Lord had
struck them. I admonished them to be honest, and
directed them to the Light of Christ in their hearts,
that by it they might see what an evil it was to follow
after theft and robbery; and the power of the Lord
came over them.</p>

<p>I stayed there till William Osburn and Robert
Widders came up, then we passed on together. But
it is likely that, if we two had gone away before, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
would have robbed Robert Widders when he had
come after alone, there being three or four of them.</p>

<p>We went to William Osburn's house, where we had
a good opportunity to declare the Truth to several
people that came in. Then we went among the Highlanders,
who were so devilish they were like to have
spoiled us and our horses; for they ran at us with
pitchforks. But through the Lord's goodness we escaped
them, being preserved by His power.</p>

<p>Thence we passed to Stirling, where the soldiers
took us up, and had us to the main guard. After a
few words with the officers, the Lord's power coming
over them, we were set at liberty; but no meeting
could we get amongst them in the town, they were
so closed up in darkness. Next morning there came
a man with a horse that was to run a race, and most
of the townspeople and officers went to see it. As
they came back from the race, I had a brave opportunity
to declare the day of the Lord and His Word
of life amongst them. Some confessed to it, and
some opposed; but the Lord's truth and power came
over them all.</p>

<p>Leaving Stirling, we came to Burntisland, where
I had two meetings at one Captain Pool's house; one
in the morning, the other in the afternoon. Whilst
they went to dine I walked to the seaside, not having
freedom to eat with them. Both he and his wife were
convinced, and became good Friends afterward; and
several officers of the army came in and received the
Truth.</p>

<p>We passed thence through several other places,
till we came to Johnstons, where were several Baptists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
that were very bitter, and came in a rage to
dispute with us. Vain janglers and disputers indeed
they were. When they could not prevail by disputing
they went and informed the governor against us;
and next morning he raised a whole company of foot,
and banished me and Alexander Parker, also James
Lancaster and Robert Widders, out of the town.</p>

<p>As they guarded us through the town, James Lancaster
was moved to sing with a melodious sound in
the power of God; and I was moved to proclaim the
day of the Lord, and preach the everlasting gospel
to the people. For the people generally came forth,
so that the streets were filled with them, and the
soldiers were so ashamed that they said they would
rather have gone to Jamaica than guarded us so.</p>

<p>But we were put into a boat with our horses, carried
over the water, and there left. The Baptists,
who were the cause of our being thus put out of this
town, were themselves, not long after, turned out of
the army; and he that was then governor was discarded
also when the king came in.</p>

<p>Being thus thrust out of Johnstons, we went to another
market-town, where Edward Billings and many
soldiers were quartered. We went to an inn, and desired
to have a meeting in the town, that we might
preach the everlasting gospel amongst them. The
officers and soldiers said we should have it in the
town-hall; but the Scotch magistrates in spite appointed
a meeting there that day for the business of
the town.</p>

<p>When the officers of the soldiery understood this,
and perceived that it was done in malice, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
have had us go into the town-hall nevertheless. But
we told them, "No; by no means; for then the magistrates
might inform the governor against us and
say, 'They took the town-hall from us by force, when
we were to do our town-business therein.'" We told
them we would go to the market-place. They said it
was market-day. We replied, "It is so much the better;
for we would have all people to hear the Truth
and know our principles."</p>

<p>Alexander Parker went and stood upon the market-cross,
with a Bible in his hand, and declared the
Truth amongst the soldiers and market-people;
but the Scots, being a dark, carnal people, gave little
heed, and hardly took notice what was said. After
awhile I was moved of the Lord to stand up at the
cross, and to declare with a loud voice the everlasting
Truth, and the day of the Lord that was coming
upon all sin and wickedness. Thereupon the people
came running out of the town-hall and gathered so
together that at last we had a large meeting; for they
only sat in the court for a colour to hinder us from
having the hall to meet in.</p>

<p>When the people were come away the magistrates
followed them. Some walked by, but some stayed
and heard; and the Lord's power came over all and
kept all quiet. The people were turned to the Lord
Jesus Christ, who died for them, and had enlightened
them, that with His Light they might see their evil
deeds, be saved from their sins by Him, and might
come to know Him to be their teacher. But if they
would not receive Christ, and own Him, it was told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
them that this Light which came from Him would
be their condemnation.</p>

<p>We travelled from this town to Leith, warning and
exhorting people, as we went, to turn to the Lord.
At Leith the innkeeper told me that the Council had
granted warrants to apprehend me, because I was not
gone out of the nation after the seven days were expired
that they had ordered me to depart in. Several
friendly people also came and told me the same;
to whom I said, "Why do ye tell me of their warrants
against me? If there were a cart-load of them
I would not heed them, for the Lord's power is over
them all."<a name="FNanchor_105_139" id="FNanchor_105_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_139" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>I went from Leith to Edinburgh again, where they
said the warrants from the Council were out against
me. I went to the inn where I had lodged before,
and no man offered to meddle with me. After I had
visited Friends in the city, I desired those that travelled
with me to get ready their horses in the morning,
and we rode out of town together. There were
with me at that time Thomas Rawlinson, Alexander
Parker, and Robert Widders.</p>

<p>When we were out of town they asked me whither
I would go. I told them it was upon me from the
Lord to go back again to Johnstons (the town out of
which we had been lately thrust), to set the power
of God and His Truth over them also. Alexander
Parker said he would go along with me; and I wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the other two to stay at a town about three miles
from Edinburgh till we returned.</p>

<p>Then Alexander and I got over the water, about
three miles across, and rode through the country;
but in the afternoon, his horse being weak and not
able to hold up with mine, I rode on ahead and got
into Johnstons just as they were drawing up the
bridges, the officers and soldiers never questioning
me. I rode up the street to Captain Davenport's
house, from which we had been banished. There
were many officers with him; and when I came
amongst them they lifted up their hands, wondering
that I should come again. But I told them the Lord
God had sent me amongst them again; so they went
their way.</p>

<p>The Baptists sent me a letter, by way of challenge,
to discourse with me next day. I sent them
word that I would meet them at such a house, about
half a mile out of the town, at such an hour. For I
considered that if I should stay in town to discourse
with them they might, under pretence of discoursing
with me, raise men to put me out of the town again,
as they had done before.</p>

<p>At the time appointed I went to the place, Captain
Davenport and his son accompanying me. There I
stayed some hours, but not one of them came. While
I stayed there waiting for them, I saw Alexander
Parker coming. Not being able to reach the town,
he had lain out the night before; and I was exceedingly
glad that we were met again.</p>

<p>This Captain Davenport was then loving to
Friends; and afterwards, coming more into obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
to Truth, he was turned out of his place for not putting
off his hat, and for saying Thou and Thee to
them.</p>

<p>When we had waited beyond reasonable ground to
expect any of them coming, we departed; and Alexander
Parker being moved to go again to the
town, where we had the meeting at the market-cross,
I passed alone to Lieutenant Foster's quarters, where
I found several officers that were convinced. Thence
I went up to the town, where I had left the other two
Friends, and we went back to Edinburgh together.</p>

<p>When we were come to the city, I bade Robert
Widders follow me; and in the dread and power of
the Lord we came up to the two first sentries. The
Lord's power came so over them that we passed by
them without any examination. Then we rode up
the street to the market-place and by the main-guard,
out at the gate by the third sentry, and so clear out
into the suburbs; and there we came to an inn and
put up our horses, it being Seventh-day. I saw and
felt that we had ridden as it were against the cannon's
mouth or the sword's point; but the Lord's
power and immediate hand carried us over the heads
of them all.</p>

<p>Next day I went to the meeting in the city,
Friends having had notice that I would attend it.
There came many officers and soldiers to it, and a
glorious meeting it was; the everlasting power of
God was set over the nation, and His Son reigned in
His glorious power. All was quiet, and no man offered
to meddle with me.</p>

<p>When the meeting was ended, and I had visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
Friends, I came out of the city to my inn again. The
next day, being Second-day, we set forward towards
the borders of England.</p>

<p>As we travelled along the country I espied a steeple-house,
and it struck at my life. I asked what
steeple-house it was, and was told that it was Dunbar.
When I came thither, and had put up at an inn,
I walked to the steeple-house, having a Friend or
two with me.</p>

<p>When we came to the steeple-house yard, one of
the chief men of the town was walking there. I
asked one of the Friends that was with me to go to
him and tell him that about the ninth hour next
morning there would be a meeting there of the people
of God called Quakers; of which we desired he
would give notice to the people of the town. He
sent me word that they were to have a lecture there
by the ninth hour; but that we might have our meeting
there by the eighth hour, if we would. We concluded
to do so, and desired him to give notice of it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the morning both poor and rich
came; and there being a captain of horse quartered
in the town, he and his troopers came also, so that
we had a large concourse; and a glorious meeting it
was, the Lord's power being over all. After some
time the priest came, and went into the steeple-house;
but we being in the yard, most of the people
stayed with us. Friends were so full and their voices
so high in the power of God, that the priest could
do little in the house, but quickly came out again,
stood awhile, and then went his way.</p>

<p>I opened to the people where they might find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Christ Jesus, and turned them to the Light with
which He had enlightened them, that in the Light
they might see Christ who died for them, turn to
Him, and know him to be their Saviour and Teacher.
I let them see that the teachers they had hitherto
followed were hirelings, who made the gospel chargeable;
showed them the wrong ways they had walked
in the night of apostasy; directed them to Christ,
the new and living way to God, and manifested unto
them how they had lost the religion and worship
which Christ set up in spirit and truth, and had hitherto
been in the religions and worships of men's making
and setting up.</p>

<p>After I had turned the people to the Spirit of God
which led the holy men of God to give forth the
Scriptures, and showed them that they must also
come to receive and be led by the same Spirit in
themselves (a measure of which was given unto every
one of them) if ever they would come to know God
and Christ and the Scriptures aright, perceiving the
other Friends to be full of power and the Word of
the Lord, I stepped down, giving way for them to declare
what they had from the Lord to the people.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of the meeting some professors
began to jangle, whereupon I stood up again, and
answered their questions, so that they seemed to be
satisfied, and our meeting ended in the Lord's power,
quiet and peaceable.</p>

<p>This was the last meeting I had in Scotland; the
Truth and the power of God was set over that nation,
and many, by the power and Spirit of God, were
turned to the Lord Jesus Christ, their Saviour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Teacher, whose blood was shed for them; and there is
since a great increase and great there will be in Scotland.
For when first I set my horse's feet upon Scottish
ground I felt the Seed of God to sparkle about
me, like innumerable sparks of fire.</p>

<p>Not but that there is abundance of the thick,
cloddy earth of hypocrisy and falseness above, and a
briery, brambly nature, which is to be burnt up with
God's Word, and ploughed up with His spiritual
plough, before God's Seed brings forth heavenly and
spiritual fruit to His glory. But the husbandman is
to wait in patience.<a name="FNanchor_106_140" id="FNanchor_106_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_140" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p class="center oldenglish">Great Events in London.</p>

<h3>1658-1659.</h3>


<p>We came into Bedfordshire, where we had large
gatherings in the name of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_107_141" id="FNanchor_107_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_141" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> After some time
we came to John Crook's, where a general yearly
meeting for the whole nation was appointed to be
held.<a name="FNanchor_108_142" id="FNanchor_108_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_142" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> This meeting lasted three days, and many
Friends from most parts of the nation came to it;
so that the inns and towns round thereabouts were
filled, for many thousands of people were at it. And
although there was some disturbance by some rude
people that had run out from Truth, yet the Lord's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
power came over all, and a glorious meeting it was.
The everlasting gospel was preached, and many received
it, which gospel brought life and immortality
to light in them, and shined over all.</p>

<p>Now these things were upon me to open unto all,
that they might mind and see what it is they sit down
in.<a name="FNanchor_AI_143" id="FNanchor_AI_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_143" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a></p>

<p>"First, They that sit down in Adam in the fall, sit
down in misery, in death, in darkness and corruption.</p>

<p>"Secondly, They that sit down in the types, figures,
and shadows, and under the first priesthood,
law, and covenant, sit down in that which must have
an end, and which made nothing perfect.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, They that sit down in the apostasy that
hath got up since the Apostles' days, sit down in spiritual
Sodom and Egypt; and are drinking of the
whore's cup, under the beast's and dragon's power.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, They that sit down in the state in
which Adam was before he fell, sit down in that
which may be fallen from; for he fell from that state,
though it was perfect.</p>

<p>"Fifthly, They that sit down in the prophets, sit
down in that which must be fulfilled; and they that
sit down in the fellowship of water, bread, and wine,
these being temporal things, they sit down in that
which is short of Christ, and of His baptism.</p>

<p>"Sixthly, To sit down in a profession of all the
Scriptures, from Genesis to the Revelations, and not
be in the power and Spirit which those were in that
gave them forth;&mdash;that was to be turned away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
by them that came into the power and Spirit which
those were in that gave forth the Scriptures.</p>

<p>"Seventhly, They that sit down in the heavenly
places in Christ Jesus, sit down in Him that never
fell, nor ever changed."</p>

<p>After this meeting was over, and most of the
Friends gone away, as I was walking in John Crook's
garden, there came a party of horse, with a constable,
to seize me. I heard them ask, "Who is in the
house?" Somebody made answer that I was there.
They said that I was the man they looked for; and
went forthwith into the house, where they had many
words with John Crook and some few Friends that
were with him. But the Lord's power so confounded
them that they came not into the garden to look for
me; but went their way in a rage.</p>

<p>When I came into the house, Friends were very
glad to see that I had escaped them. Next day I
passed thence; and, after I had visited Friends in
several places, came to London, the Lord's power
accompanying me, and bearing me up in His service.</p>

<p>During the time I was at London I had many services
laid upon me, for it was a time of much suffering.
I was moved to write to Oliver Cromwell, and
lay before him the sufferings of Friends both in this
nation and in Ireland. There was also a talk
about this time of making Cromwell king; whereupon
I was moved to go to him and warn him against
accepting it; and of divers dangers which, if he did
not avoid them, would, I told him, bring shame and
ruin upon himself and his posterity. He seemed to
take well what I said to him, and thanked me; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
afterwards I was moved to write to him more fully
concerning that matter.</p>

<p>About this time the Lady Claypole (so called) was
sick, and much troubled in mind, and could receive
no comfort from any that came to her. When I
heard of this I was moved to write to her.<a name="FNanchor_109_144" id="FNanchor_109_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_144" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>
<p>About this time came forth a declaration from
Oliver Cromwell, the Protector, for a collection towards
the relief of divers Protestant churches, driven
out of Poland; and of twenty Protestant families,
driven out of the confines of Bohemia. And there
having been a like declaration published some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
before, to invite the nation to a day of solemn fasting
and humiliation, in order to a contribution being
made for the suffering Protestants of the valleys of
Lucerne, Angrona, etc., who were persecuted by the
Duke of Savoy,<a name="FNanchor_110_145" id="FNanchor_110_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_145" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> I was moved to write to the Protector
and chief magistrates on this occasion, both to
show them the nature of a true fast (such as God
requires and accepts), and to make them sensible of
their injustice and self-condemnation in blaming the
Papists for persecuting the Protestants abroad, while
they themselves, calling themselves Protestants,
were at the same time persecuting their Protestant
neighbours and friends at home.</p>

<p>Divers times, both in the time of the Long Parliament
and of the Protector (so called) and of the
Committee of Safety, when they proclaimed fasts, I
was moved to write to them, and tell them their fasts
were like unto Jezebel's; for commonly, when they
proclaimed fasts, there was some mischief contrived
against us. I knew their fasts were for strife and
debate, to smite with the fist of wickedness; as the
New England professors soon after did; who, before
they put our Friends to death, proclaimed a fast
also.</p>

<p>Now it was a time of great suffering; and many
Friends being in prisons, many other Friends were
moved to go to the Parliament, to offer themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
up to lie in the same prisons where their friends lay,
that those in prison might go forth, and not perish
in the stinking jails. This we did in love to God and
our brethren, that they might not die in prison; and
in love to those that cast them in, that they might
not bring innocent blood upon their own heads,
which we knew would cry to the Lord, and bring His
wrath, vengeance, and plagues upon them.</p>

<p>But little favour could we find from those professing
Parliaments; instead thereof, they would rage,
and sometimes threaten Friends that attended them,
to whip and send them home. Then commonly soon
after the Lord would turn them out, and send them
home; who had not an heart to do good in the day
of their power. But they went not off without being
forewarned; for I was moved to write to them, in
their several turns, as I did to the Long Parliament,
unto whom I declared, before they were broken up,
"that thick darkness was coming over them all, even
a day of darkness that should be felt."</p>

<p>And because the Parliament that now sat was
made up mostly of high professors, who, pretending
to be more religious than others, were indeed greater
persecutors of those that were truly religious, I was
moved to send them the following lines, as a reproof
of their hypocrisy:<a name="FNanchor_111_146" id="FNanchor_111_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_146" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"O friends, do not cloak and cover yourselves;
there is a God that knoweth your hearts, and that
will uncover you. He seeth your way. 'Wo be unto
him that covereth, but not with my Spirit, saith the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Lord.' Do ye act contrary to the law, and then put
it from you! Mercy and true judgment ye neglect.
Look, what was spoken against such. My Saviour
spoke against such; 'I was sick, and ye visited me
not; I was hungry, and ye fed me not; I was a
stranger, and ye took me not in; I was in prison, and
ye visited me not.' But they said, 'When saw we
thee in prison, and did not come to thee?' 'Inasmuch
as ye did it not unto one of these little ones,
ye did it not unto me.' Friends, ye imprison them
that are in the life and power of Truth, and yet profess
to be the ministers of Christ; but if Christ had
sent you, ye would bring out of prison, out of bondage,
and receive strangers. Ye have lived in pleasure
on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished
your hearts, as in a day of slaughter; ye have
condemned and killed the just, and he doth not resist
you.</p>

<p class="signature">
G. F."
</p></blockquote>

<p>After this, as I was going out of town, having two
Friends with me, when we were little more than a
mile out of the city, there met us two troopers belonging
to Colonel Hacker's regiment, who took me,
and the Friends that were with me, and brought us
back to the Mews, and there kept us prisoners. But
the Lord's power was so over them that they did not
take us before any officer; but shortly after set us
at liberty again.</p>

<p>The same day, taking boat, I went to Kingston,
and thence to Hampton Court, to speak with the Protector
about the sufferings of Friends. I met him
riding in Hampton Court Park, and before I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
to him, as he rode at the head of his life-guard, I saw
and felt a waft [or apparition] of death go forth
against him; and when I came to him he looked like
a dead man.</p>

<p>After I had laid the sufferings of Friends before
him, and had warned him, according as I was moved
to speak to him, he bade me come to his house. So
I returned to Kingston, and next day went to Hampton
Court, to speak further with him. But when I
came he was sick, and &mdash;&mdash; Harvey,<a name="FNanchor_AJ_147" id="FNanchor_AJ_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_147" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> who was one
that waited on him, told me the doctors were not
willing I should speak with him. So I passed away,
and never saw him more.<a name="FNanchor_112_148" id="FNanchor_112_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_148" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>From Kingston I went to Isaac Penington's,<a name="FNanchor_113_149" id="FNanchor_113_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_149" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> in
Buckinghamshire, where I had appointed a meeting,
and the Lord's Truth and power were preciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
manifested amongst us. After I had visited Friends
in those parts, I returned to London, and soon after
went into Essex, where I had not been long before
I heard that the Protector was dead, and his son
Richard made Protector in his room. Thereupon I
came up to London again.</p>

<p>Before this time the church faith (so called) was
given forth, which was said to have been made at the
Savoy in eleven days' time.<a name="FNanchor_114_150" id="FNanchor_114_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_150" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I got a copy before it
was published, and wrote an answer to it; and when
their book of church faith was sold in the streets, my
answer to it was sold also. This angered some of the
Parliament men, so that one of them told me, "We
must have you to Smithfield." I told him, "I am
above your fires, and fear them not." And, reasoning
with him, I wished him to consider, had all people
been without a faith these sixteen hundred years,
that now the priests must make them one? Did not
the apostle say that Jesus was the author and finisher
of their faith? And since Christ Jesus was the author
of the Apostles' faith, of the Church's faith in
primitive times, and of the martyrs' faith, should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
all people look unto Him to be the author and finisher
of their faith, and not to the priests? Much
work we had about the priest-made faith.</p>

<p>There was great persecution in many places, both
by imprisoning, and by breaking up of meetings. At
a meeting about seven miles from London, the rude
people usually came out of several parishes round
about, to abuse Friends, and often beat and bruised
them exceedingly. One day they abused about
eighty Friends that went to that meeting out of London,
tearing their coats and cloaks from off their
backs, and throwing them into ditches and ponds;
and when they had besmeared them with dirt, they
said they looked like witches.</p>

<p>The next First-day I was moved of the Lord to go
to that meeting, though I was then very weak.
When I came there I bade Friends bring a table, and
set it in the close, where they used to meet, to stand
upon. According to their wonted course, the rude
people came; and I, having a Bible in my hand,
showed them theirs and their teachers' fruits; and
the people became ashamed, and were quiet.</p>

<p>But it was a time of great sufferings; for, besides
imprisonments, through which many died, our meetings
were greatly disturbed. They have thrown rotten
eggs and wild-fire into our meetings, and brought
in drums beating, and kettles to make noises with,
that the Truth might not be heard; and, among these,
the priests were as rude as any, as may be seen in the
book of the fighting priests, wherein a list is given
of some priests that had actually beaten and abused
Friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Many Friends were brought prisoners to London,
to be tried before the Committee; where Henry
Vane, being chairman, would not suffer Friends to
come in, except they would put off their hats.<a name="FNanchor_115_151" id="FNanchor_115_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_151" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But
at last the Lord's power came over him, so that,
through the mediation of others, they were admitted.
Many of us having been imprisoned upon contempts
(as they called them) for not putting off our hats,
it was not a likely thing that Friends, who had suffered
so long for it from others, should put off their
hats to him. But the Lord's power came over all,
and wrought so that several were set at liberty by
them.</p>

<p>I wrote to Oliver several times, and let him know
that while he was persecuting God's people, they
whom he accounted his enemies were preparing to
come upon him. When some forward spirits that
came amongst us would have bought Somerset-House,
that we might have meetings in it, I forbade
them to do so: for I then foresaw the King's coming
in again. Besides, there came a woman to me in the
Strand, who had a prophecy concerning King
Charles's coming in, three years before he came: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
she told me she must go to him to declare it. I advised
her to wait upon the Lord, and keep it to herself;
for if it should be known that she went on such
a message, they would look upon it to be treason: but
she said she must go, and tell him that he should be
brought into England again.</p>

<p>I saw her prophecy was true, and that a great
stroke must come upon them in power; for they that
had then got possession were so exceeding high, and
such great persecution was acted by them, who called
themselves saints, that they would take from Friends
their copyhold lands, because they could not swear
in their courts.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we laid these sufferings before
Oliver Cromwell, he would not believe it. Therefore
Thomas Aldam and Anthony Pearson were moved
to go through all the jails in England, and to get
copies of Friends' commitments under the jailer's
hands, that they might lay the weight of their sufferings
upon Oliver Cromwell. And when he would not
give order for the releasing of them, Thomas Aldam
was moved to take his cap from off his head, and to
rend it in pieces before him, and to say unto him,
"So shall thy government be rent from thee and thy
house."</p>

<p>Another Friend also, a woman, was moved to go
to the Parliament (that was envious against Friends)
with a pitcher in her hand, which she broke into
pieces before them, and told them that so should they
be broken to pieces: which came to pass shortly
after.</p>

<p>In my great suffering and travail of spirit for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
nation, being grievously burdened with their hypocrisy,
treachery, and falsehood, I saw God would
bring that over them which they had been above;
and that all must be brought down to that which convinced
them, before they could get over that bad
spirit within and without: for it is the pure, invisible
Spirit, that doth and only can work down all deceit
in people.</p>

<p>Now was there a great pother made about the
image or effigy of Oliver Cromwell lying in state;
men standing and sounding with trumpets over his
image, after he was dead. At this my spirit was
greatly grieved, and the Lord, I found, was highly
offended.</p>

<p>About this time great stirs were in the nation, the
minds of people being unsettled. Much plotting and
contriving there was by the several factions, to carry
on their several interests. And a great care being
upon me, lest any young or ignorant people,
that might sometimes come amongst us, should be
drawn into that snare, I was moved to give forth an
epistle<a name="FNanchor_116_152" id="FNanchor_116_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_152" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> as a warning unto all such.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">In the First Year of King Charles.</p>

<h3>1660.</h3>


<p>I entered Bristol on the Seventh day of the week.<a name="FNanchor_117_153" id="FNanchor_117_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_153" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
The day before, the soldiers came with their muskets
into the meeting, and were exceedingly rude, beating
and striking Friends with them, and drove them out
of the orchard in a great rage, threatening what they
would do if Friends came there again. For the mayor
and the commander of the soldiers had, it seems,
combined together to make a disturbance amongst
Friends.</p>

<p>When Friends told me what a rage there was in
the town, how they were threatened by the mayor
and soldiers, and how unruly the soldiers had been
the day before, I sent for several Friends, as George
Bishop, Thomas Gouldney, Thomas Speed, and Edward
Pyot, and desired them to go to the mayor and
aldermen, and request them, seeing he and they had
broken up our meetings, to let Friends have the
town-hall to meet in. For the use of it Friends would
give them twenty pounds a-year, to be distributed
amongst the poor and when the mayor and aldermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
had business to do in it, Friends would not meet in
it, but only on First-days.</p>

<p>These Friends were astonished at this, and said
the mayor and aldermen would think that they were
mad. I said, Nay; for this would be a considerable
benefit to the poor. And it was upon me from the
Lord to bid them go. At last they consented, and
went, though in the cross to their own wills.</p>

<p>When they had laid the thing before the mayor, he
said, "For my part I could consent to it, but I am
but one"; and he told Friends of another great hall
they might have; but that they did not accept, it
being inconvenient.</p>

<p>So Friends came away, leaving the mayor in a very
loving frame towards them; for they felt the Lord's
power had come over him. When they came back, I
spoke to them to go also to the colonel that commanded
the soldiers, and lay before him the rude
conduct of his soldiers, how they came armed
amongst innocent people, who were waiting upon and
worshipping the Lord; but they were backward to go
to him.</p>

<p>Next morning, being First-day, we went to the
meeting in the orchard, where the soldiers had lately
been so rude. After I had declared the Truth some
time in the meeting, there came in many rude soldiers
and people, some with drawn swords. The innkeepers
had made some of them drunk; and one had
bound himself with an oath to cut down and kill the
man that spoke. He came pressing in, through all
the crowd of people, to within two yards of me, and
stopped at those four Friends before mentioned (who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
should have gone to the colonel as I would have had
them), and began jangling with them. Suddenly I
saw his sword was put up and gone: for the Lord's
power came over all, and chained him with the rest.
We had a blessed meeting, and the Lord's everlasting
power and presence were felt amongst us.</p>

<p>On the day following, the four Friends went and
spoke with the colonel, and he sent for the soldiers,
and cut and slashed some of them before the Friends'
faces. When I heard of this I blamed the Friends
for letting him do so, and also that they did not go on
the Seventh-day, as I would have had them, which
might have prevented this cutting of the soldiers, and
the trouble they gave at our meeting. But thus the
Lord's power came over all those persecuting, bloody
minds, and the meeting there was held in peace for a
good while after without disturbance.</p>

<p>I had then also a general meeting at Edward
Pyot's, near Bristol, at which it was judged were
several thousands of people:<a name="FNanchor_118_154" id="FNanchor_118_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_154" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> for besides Friends
from many parts thereabouts, some of the Baptists
and Independents, with their teachers, came to it, and
many of the sober people of Bristol; insomuch that
the people who stayed behind said the city looked
naked, so many were gone out of it to this meeting.
It was very quiet, and many glorious truths were
opened to the people.</p>

<p>As we had much work with priests and professors
who pleaded for imperfection, I was opened to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and manifest to them that Adam and Eve were
perfect before they fell, and all that God made He
saw was good, and He blessed it; but the imperfection
came in by the fall, through man's and woman's
hearkening to the devil who was out of Truth. And
though the law made nothing perfect, yet it made
way for the bringing in of the better hope, which
hope is Christ, who destroys the devil and his works,
which made man and woman imperfect.</p>

<p>Christ saith to His disciples, "Be ye perfect, even
as your heavenly Father is perfect": and He, who
Himself was perfect, comes to make man and woman
perfect again, and brings them again to the state in
which God made them. So He is the maker-up of
the breach, and the peace betwixt God and man.</p>

<p>That this might the better be understood by the
lowest capacities, I used a comparison of two old
people who had their house broken down by an
enemy, so that they, with all their children, were
liable to all storms and tempests. And there came
to them some that pretended to be workmen, and
offered to build up their house again, if they would
give them so much a year; but when they had got
the money they left the house as they found it.</p>

<p>After this manner came a second, third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth, each with his several pretence to
build up the old house, and each got the people's
money, and then cried that they could not rear up
the house, the breach could not be made up; for
there is no perfection here. They tell the old people
that the house can never be perfectly built up again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
in this life, though they have taken the people's
money for doing it.</p>

<p>So all the sect-masters in Christendom (so called)
have pretended to build up Adam's and Eve's fallen
house; and when they have got the people's money,
they tell them the work cannot be perfectly done
here; so their house lies as it did. But I told the
people Christ was come to do it freely, who by one
offering hath perfected for ever all them that are
sanctified, and renews them up into the image of
God, which man and woman were in before they fell,
and makes man's and woman's house as perfect again
as God made them at the first; and this Christ, the
heavenly Man, doth freely. Therefore all are to look
unto Him, and all that have received Him are to
walk in Him, the Life, the Substance, the First, and
the Last, the Rock of Ages, the Foundation of many
Generations.</p>

<p>About this time the soldiers under General Monk's
command were rude and troublesome at Friends'
meetings in many places, whereof complaint being
made to him he gave forth the following order, which
somewhat restrained them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="head">
"St. James's, the 9th of March, 1659.
</p>

<p>"I do require all officers and soldiers to forbear to
disturb the peaceable meetings of the Quakers, they
doing nothing prejudicial to the Parliament or Commonwealth
of England.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">George Monk.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>We passed thence to Tewkesbury and so to Worcester,
visiting Friends in their meetings as we went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
And in all my time I never saw such drunkenness as
in the towns, for they had been choosing Parliament
men. At Worcester the Lord's Truth was set over all,
people were finely settled therein, and Friends
praised the Lord; nay, I saw the very earth rejoiced.</p>

<p>Yet great fears and troubles were in many people,
and a looking for the King's coming in, and all things
being altered. They would ask me what I thought
of times and things. I told them the Lord's power
was over all, and His light shone over all; that fear
would take hold only on the hypocrites, such as had
not been faithful to God, and on our persecutors.</p>

<p>In my travail and sufferings at Reading, when people
were at a stand, and could not tell what might
come in, and who might rule, I told them the Lord's
power was over all (for I had travelled through in
it), and His day shined, whosoever should come in;
and whether the King came in or not, all would be
well to them that loved the Lord, and were faithful
to Him. Therefore I bade all Friends fear none but
the Lord, and keep in His power.</p>

<p>From Worcester I visited Friends in their meetings,
till I came to Badgley, and thence I went to
Drayton, in Leicestershire, to visit my relations.
While there, one Burton, a justice, hearing I had a
good horse, sent a warrant to search for me and my
horse; but I was gone before they came; and so he
missed of his wicked end.</p>

<p>I passed on to Twy-Cross, Swannington, and
Derby, where I visited Friends, and found amongst
them my old jailer, who had formerly kept me in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
house of correction there, now convinced of the
Truth which I then suffered under him for.</p>

<p>Passing into Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, I
came to Synderhill-Green, visiting Friends through
all those parts in their meetings, and so on to Balby
in Yorkshire, where our Yearly Meeting at that time
was held in a great orchard of John Killam's, where
it was supposed some thousands of people and
Friends were gathered together.</p>

<p>In the morning I heard that a troop of horse was
sent from York to break up our meeting, and that
the militia, newly raised, was to join them. I went
into the meeting, and stood up on a great stool, and
after I had spoken some time two trumpeters came
up, sounding their trumpets near me, and the captain
of the troop cried, "Divide to the right and left, and
make way." Then they rode up to me.</p>

<p>I was declaring the everlasting Truth and Word
of life in the mighty power of the Lord. The captain
bade me come down, for he was come to disperse our
meeting. After some time I told him they all knew
we were a peaceable people, and used to have such
great meetings; but if he apprehended that we met in
a hostile way, I desired him to make search among us,
and if he found either sword or pistol about any
there, let such suffer.</p>

<p>He told me he must see us dispersed, for he came
all night on purpose to disperse us. I asked him what
honour it would be to him to ride with swords and
pistols amongst so many unarmed men and women as
there were. If he would be still and quiet our meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
probably might not continue above two or three
hours; and when it was done, as we came peaceably
together, so we should part; for he might perceive
the meeting was so large, that all the country thereabouts
could not entertain them, but that they intended
to depart towards their homes at night.</p>

<p>He said he could not stay to see the meeting ended,
but must disperse them before he went. I desired
him, then, if he himself could not stay, that he would
let a dozen of his soldiers stay, and see the order and
peaceableness of our meeting. He said he would permit
us an hour's time, and left half a dozen soldiers
with us. Then he went away with his troop, and
Friends of the house gave the soldiers that stayed,
and their horses, some meat.</p>

<p>When the captain was gone the soldiers that were
left told us we might stay till night if we would. But
we stayed but about three hours after, and had a
glorious, powerful meeting; for the presence of the
living God was manifest amongst us, and the Seed,
Christ, was set over all. Friends were built upon
Him, the foundation, and settled under His glorious,
heavenly teaching.</p>

<p>After the meeting Friends passed away in peace,
greatly refreshed with the presence of the Lord, and
filled with joy and gladness that the Lord's power had
given them such dominion. Many of the militia-soldiers
stayed also, much vexed that the captain and
troopers had not broken up our meeting; and cursed
the captain and his troopers. It was reported that
they intended evil against us that day; but the troopers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
instead of assisting them, were rather assistant
to us, in not joining them as they expected, but preventing
them from doing the mischief they designed.</p>

<p>This captain was a desperate man; for it was he
that said to me in Scotland that he would obey his
superior's commands; if it were to crucify Christ he
would do it, or would execute the great Turk's commands
against the Christians if he were under him.
So that it was an eminent power of the Lord which
chained both him and his troopers, and those envious
militia-soldiers also, who went away, not having
power to hurt any of us, nor to break up our meeting.</p>

<p>Next day we had an heavenly meeting at Warmsworth
of Friends in the ministry, with several others;
and then Friends parted. As they passed through
the country several were taken up; for on the day on
which our first meeting was held, Lambert was
routed, and it made great confusion in the country;
but Friends were not kept long in prison at that
time.</p>

<p>As I went to this meeting there came to me several
at Skegby, in Nottinghamshire, who were going to
be soldiers under Lambert, and would have bought
my horse of me. Because I would not sell him, they
were in a great rage against me, using many threatening
words: but I told them that God would confound
and scatter them; and within two or three days
after they were scattered indeed.</p>

<p>From Warmsworth I passed, in the Lord's power,
to Barton Abbey, where I had a great meeting;
thence to Thomas Taylor's; and so on to Skipton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
where was a general meeting of men Friends out of
many counties concerning the affairs of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_119_155" id="FNanchor_119_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_155" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>A Friend went naked through the town, declaring
Truth, and was much beaten.<a name="FNanchor_120_156" id="FNanchor_120_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_156" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Some other Friends
also came to me all bloody. As I walked in the
street, a desperate fellow had an intent to do me mischief;
but he was prevented, and our meeting was
quiet.</p>

<p>To this meeting came many Friends out of most
parts of the nation; for it was about business relating
to the Church both in this nation and beyond the
seas. Several years before, when I was in the north,
I was moved to recommend to Friends the setting up
of this meeting for that service; for many Friends
had suffered in divers parts of the nation, their goods
were taken from them contrary to law, and they
understood not how to help themselves, or where to
seek redress.<a name="FNanchor_121_157" id="FNanchor_121_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_157" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But after this meeting was set up,
several Friends who had been magistrates, and others
that understood something of the law, came thither,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
and were able to inform Friends, and to assist them
in gathering up the sufferings, that they might be
laid before the justices, judges, or Parliament.</p>

<p>This meeting had stood several years, and divers
justices and captains had come to break it up, but
when they understood the business Friends met
about, and saw their books and accounts of collections
for relief of the poor, how we took care one
county to help another, and to help our Friends beyond
the seas, and provide for our poor, that none
of them should be chargeable to their parishes, etc.,
the justices and officers confessed we did their work,
and passed away peaceably and lovingly, commending
Friends' practice.</p>

<p>Sometimes there would come two hundred of the
poor of other people, and wait there till the meeting
was done (for all the country knew we met about the
poor), and after the meeting Friends would send to
the bakers for bread, and give every one of these
poor people a loaf, how many soever there were of
them; for we were taught to "do good unto all;
though especially to the household of faith."</p>

<p>After this meeting I visited Friends in their meetings
till I came to Lancaster; whence I went to
Robert Widders's, and so on to Arnside, where I had
a general meeting for all the Friends in Westmoreland,
Cumberland, and Lancashire. It was quiet and
peaceable, and the living presence of the Lord was
amongst us. I went back with Robert Widders; and
Friends all passed away, fresh in the life and power
of Christ, in which they had dominion, being settled
upon Him, the heavenly Rock and Foundation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>I went next day to Swarthmore, Francis Howgill
and Thomas Curtis being with me. I had not been
long there before Henry Porter, a justice, sent a
warrant by the chief constable and three petty constables
to apprehend me. I had a sense of this beforehand;
and being in the parlor with Richard Richardson
and Margaret Fell, her servants came and told
her there were some come to search the house for
arms; and they went up into the chambers under that
pretence.</p>

<p>It came upon me to go out to them; and as I was
going by some of them I spoke to them; whereupon
they asked me my name. I readily told them my
name; and then they laid hold on me, saying that I
was the man they looked for, and led me away to
Ulverstone.</p>

<p>They kept me all night at the constable's house,
and set a guard of fifteen or sixteen men to watch me;
some of whom sat in the chimney, for fear I should
go up it; such dark imaginations possessed them.
They were very rude and uncivil, and would neither
suffer me to speak to Friends, nor suffer them to
bring me necessaries; but with violence thrust them
out, and kept a strong guard upon me. Very wicked
and rude they were, and a great noise they made
about me. One of the constables, whose name was
Ashburnham, said he did not think a thousand men
could have taken me. Another of the constables,
whose name was Mount, a very wicked man, said he
would have served Judge Fell himself so, if he had
been alive, and he had had a warrant for him.</p>

<p>Next morning, about six, I was putting on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
boots and spurs to go with them before some justice;
but they pulled off my spurs, took my knife out of
my pocket, and hurried me away through the town,
with a party of horse and abundance of people, not
suffering me to stay till my own horse came down.</p>

<p>When I was gone about a quarter of a mile with
them, some Friends, with Margaret Fell and her children,
came towards me; and then a great party of
horse gathered about me in a mad rage and fury, crying
out, "Will they rescue him? Will they rescue
him?" Thereupon I said unto them, "Here is my
hair; here is my back; here are my cheeks; strike
on!" With these words their heat was a little
assuaged.</p>

<p>Then they brought a little horse, and two of them
took up one of my legs and put my foot in the stirrup,
and two or three lifting over my other leg, set me
upon it behind the saddle, and so led the horse by the
halter; but I had nothing to hold by. When they
were come some distance out of the town they beat
the little horse, and made him kick and gallop.
Thereupon I slipped off him. I told them they should
not abuse the creature. They were much enraged at
my getting off, and took me by the legs and feet, and
set me upon the same horse, behind the saddle again;
and so led it about two miles till they came to a great
water called the Carter-Ford.</p>

<p>By this time my own horse was come to us, and the
water being deep, and their little horse scarcely able
to carry me through, they let me get upon my own,
through the persuasion of some of their own company,
leading him through the water. One wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
fellow kneeled down, and, lifting up his hands,
blessed God that I was taken.</p>

<p>When I was come over the Sands, I told them that
I heard I had liberty to choose what justice I would
go before; but Mount and the other constables cried,
"No, you shall not." Then they led me to Lancaster,
about fourteen miles, and a great triumph they
thought to have had; but as they led me I was moved
to sing praises to the Lord, in His power triumphing
over all.</p>

<p>When I was come to Lancaster, the spirits of the
people being mightily up, I stood and looked earnestly
upon them, and they cried, "Look at his
eyes!"<a name="FNanchor_122_158" id="FNanchor_122_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_158" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> After a while I spoke to them, and they
were pretty sober. Then came a young man who took
me to his house, and after a little time the officers
took me to the house of Major Porter, the justice
who had sent the warrant against me, and who had
several others with him.</p>

<p>When I came in, I said, "Peace be amongst you."
Porter asked me why I came into the country at that
troublesome time.<a name="FNanchor_123_159" id="FNanchor_123_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_159" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> I told him, "To visit my brethren."
"But," said he, "you have great meetings up
and down." I told him that though we had, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
meetings were known throughout the nation to be
peaceable, and we were a peaceable people.</p>

<p>He said that we saw the devil in people's faces. I
told him that if I saw a drunkard, or a swearer, or a
peevish heady man, I could not say I saw the Spirit
of God in him. And I asked him if he could see the
Spirit of God. He said we cried against their
ministers. I told him that while we were as Saul,
sitting under the priests, and running up and down
with their packets of letters, we were never called
pestilent fellows nor makers of sects; but when we
were come to exercise our consciences towards God
and man, we were called pestilent fellows, as Paul
was.</p>

<p>He said we could express ourselves well enough,
and he would not dispute with me; but he would
restrain me. I desired to know for what, and by
whose order he had sent his warrant for me; and I
complained to him of the abuse of the constables and
other officers after they had taken me, and in their
bringing me thither. He would not take notice of
that, but told me he had an order, but would not let
me see it; for he would not reveal the King's secrets;
and besides, "A prisoner," he said, "is not to see for
what he is committed." I told him that was not reason;
for how, then, should he make his defence? I
said I ought to have a copy of it. But he said there
was a judge once that fined one for letting a prisoner
have a copy of his mittimus; "and," said he, "I have
an old clerk, though I am a young justice."</p>

<p>Then he called to his clerk, saying, "Is it not
ready yet? Bring it"; meaning the mittimus. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
it not being ready, he told me I was a disturber of
the nation. I told him I had been a blessing to the
nation, in and through the Lord's power and Truth;
and that the Spirit of God in all consciences would
answer it. Then he charged me as an enemy to the
King, that I endeavoured to raise a new war, and
imbrue the nation in blood again. I told him I had
never learned the postures of war, but was clear and
innocent as a child concerning those things; and
therefore was bold.</p>

<p>Then came the clerk with the mittimus, and the
jailer was sent for and commanded to take me, put
me into the Dark-house, and let none come at me,
but to keep me there close prisoner till I should be
delivered by the King or Parliament. Then the justice
asked the constables where my horse was.
"For I hear," said he, "he hath a good horse; have
ye brought his horse?" I told him where my horse
was, but he did not meddle with him.</p>

<p>As they had me to the jail the constable gave me
my knife again, and then asked me to give it to him.
I told him, Nay; he had not been so civil to me. So
they put me into the jail, and the under-jailer, one
Hardy, a very wicked man, was exceeding rude and
cruel, and many times would not let me have meat
brought in but as I could get it under the door.
Many came to look at me, some in a rage, and very
uncivil and rude.</p>

<p>Being now a close prisoner in the common jail at
Lancaster, I desired Thomas Cummins and Thomas
Green to go to the jailer, and desire of him a copy
of my mittimus, that I might know what I stood committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
for. They went and the jailer answered that
he could not give a copy of it, for another had
been fined for so doing; but he gave them liberty to
read it over. To the best of their remembrance the
matters therein charged against me were that I was
a person generally suspected to be a common disturber
of the peace of the nation, an enemy to the
King, and a chief upholder of the Quakers' sect; and
that, together with others of my fanatic opinion, I
had of late endeavoured to raise insurrections in these
parts of the country, and to embroil the whole kingdom
in blood. Wherefore the jailer was commanded
to keep me in safe custody until I should be released
by order of the King and Parliament.</p>

<p>When I had thus got the heads of the charge contained
in the mittimus, I wrote a plain answer in vindication
of my innocency in each particular; as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am a prisoner at Lancaster, committed by Justice
Porter. A copy of the mittimus I cannot get,
but such expressions I am told are in it as are very
untrue; as that I am generally suspected to be a common
disturber of the nation's peace, an enemy to the
King, and that I, with others, endeavour to raise insurrections
to embroil the nation in blood; all of
which is utterly false, and I do, in every part thereof,
deny it.</p>

<p>"For I am not a person generally suspected to be
a disturber of the nation's peace, nor have I given
any cause for such suspicion; for through the nation
I have been tried for these things formerly. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
days of Oliver I was taken up on pretence of raising
arms against him, which was also false; for I meddled
not with raising arms at all. Yet I was
then carried up a prisoner to London, and brought
before him; when I cleared myself, and denied the
drawing of a carnal weapon against him, or any man
upon the earth; for my weapons are spiritual, which
take away the occasion of war, and lead into peace.
Upon my declaring this to Oliver, I was set at liberty
by him.</p>

<p>"After this I was taken and sent to prison by Major
Ceely in Cornwall, who, when I was brought before
the judge, informed against me that I took him
aside, and told him that I could raise forty thousand
men in an hour's time, to involve the nation in blood,
and bring in King Charles. This also was utterly
false, and a lie of his own inventing, as was then
proved upon him for I never spoke any such word
to him.</p>

<p>"I never was found in any plot; I never took any
engagement or oath; nor have I ever learned war-postures.
As those were false charges against me then,
so are these now which come from Major Porter, who
is lately appointed to be justice, but formerly wanted
power to exercise his cruelty against us; which is but
the wickedness of the old enemy. The peace of the
nation I am not a disturber of, nor ever was; but I
seek the peace of it, and of all men, and stand for all
nations' peace, and all men's peace upon the earth,
and wish all knew my innocency in these things.</p>

<p>"And whereas Major Porter saith I am an enemy
to the King, this is false; for my love is to him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
to all men, even though they be enemies to God, to
themselves, and to me. And I can say it is of the
Lord that the King is come in, to bring down many
unrighteously set up; of which I had a sight three
years before he came in. It is much Major Porter
should say I am an enemy to the King; for I have no
reason so to be, he having done nothing against me.</p>

<p>"But I have been often imprisoned and persecuted
these eleven or twelve years by those that have
been both against the King and his father, even the
party by whom Porter was made a major and for
whom he bore arms; but not by them that were for
the King. I was never an enemy to the King, nor to
any man's person upon the earth. I am in the love
that fulfils the law, which thinks no evil, but loves
even enemies; and would have the King saved, and
come to the knowledge of the Truth, and be brought
into the fear of the Lord, to receive His wisdom from
above, by which all things were made and created;
that with that wisdom he may order all things to the
glory of God.</p>

<p>"Whereas he calleth me 'A chief upholder of the
Quakers' sect,' I answer: The Quakers are not a
sect,<a name="FNanchor_124_160" id="FNanchor_124_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_160" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> but are in the power of God, which was before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
sects were, and witness the election before the world
began, and are come to live in the life in which the
prophets and apostles lived, who gave forth the Scriptures;
therefore are we hated by envious, wrathful,
wicked, persecuting men. But God is the upholder
of us all by His mighty power, and preserves us from
the wrath of the wicked that would swallow us up.</p>

<p>"And whereas he saith that I, together with
others of my fanatic opinion, as he calls it, have of
late endeavoured to raise insurrections, and to embroil
the whole kingdom in blood, I answer, This is
altogether false. To these things I am as a child;
I know nothing of them. The postures of war I
never learned; my weapons are spiritual and
not carnal, for with carnal weapons I do not fight.
I am a follower of Him who said, 'My kingdom is not
of this world,' and though these lies and slanders are
raised upon me, I deny drawing any carnal weapon
against the King or Parliament, or any man upon the
earth. For I am come to the end of the Law, but
am in that which saves men's lives. A witness I am
against all murderers, plotters, and all such as would
imbrue the nation in blood; for it is not in my heart
to have any man's life destroyed.</p>

<p>"And as for the word fanatic, which signifies furious,
foolish, mad, etc., he might have considered
himself before he had used that word, and have
learned the humility which goes before honour. We
are not furious, foolish, or mad; but through patience
and meekness have borne lies, slanders and
persecutions many years, and have undergone great
sufferings. The spiritual man, that wrestles not with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
flesh and blood, and the Spirit that reproves sin in the
gate, which is the Spirit of Truth, wisdom, and sound
judgment, is not mad, foolish, furious, which fanatic
signifies; but all are of a mad, furious, foolish spirit
that in their furiousness, foolishness and rage wrestle
with flesh and blood, with carnal weapons. This is
not the Spirit of God, but of error, that persecutes
in a mad, blind zeal, like Nebuchadnezzar and Saul.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as I am ordered to be kept prisoner
till I be delivered by order from the King or Parliament,
therefore I have written these things to be laid
before you, the King and Parliament, that ye may
consider of them before ye act anything therein;
that ye may weigh, in the wisdom of God, the intent
and end of men's spirits, lest ye act the thing that
will bring the hand of the Lord upon you and against
you, as many who have been in authority have done
before you, whom God hath overthrown. In Him we
trust whom we fear and cry unto day and night, who
hath heard us, doth hear us, and will hear us, and
avenge our cause. Much innocent blood hath been
shed. Many have been persecuted to death by such
as were in authority before you, whom God hath
vomited out because they turned against the just.
Therefore consider your standing now that ye have
the day, and receive this as a warning of love to you.</p>

<p>After this Margaret Fell determined to go to London,
to speak with the King about my being taken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and to show him the manner of it, and the unjust
dealing and evil usage I had received.<a name="FNanchor_125_161" id="FNanchor_125_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_161" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> When Justice
Porter heard of this, he vapoured that he would
go and meet her in the gap. But when he came before
the King, having been a zealous man for the
Parliament against the King, several of the courtiers
spoke to him concerning his plundering their houses;
so that he quickly had enough of the court, and soon
returned into the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the jailer seemed very fearful, and said
he was afraid Major Porter would hang him because
he had not put me in the dark-house. But when the
jailer waited on him after his return from London,
he was very blank and down, and asked how I did,
pretending he would find a way to set me at liberty.
But having overshot himself in his mittimus by ordering
me "to be kept a prisoner till I should be
delivered by the King or Parliament," he had put
it out of his power to release me if he would.</p>

<p>He was the more down also upon reading a letter
which I sent him; for when he was in the height of
his rage and threats against me, and thought to ingratiate
himself into the King's favour by imprisoning
me, I was moved to write to him and put him
in mind how fierce he had been against the King and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
his party, though now he would be thought zealous
for the King.</p>

<p>Among other things in my letter I called to his
remembrance that when he held Lancaster Castle for
the Parliament against the King, he was so rough
and fierce against those that favoured the King that
he said he would leave them neither dog nor cat, if
they did not bring him provision to the Castle.
I asked him also whose great buck's horns
were those that were in his house; and whence
he had both them and the wainscot with which he
ceiled his house; had he them not from Hornby
Castle?</p>

<p>About this time Ann Curtis, of Reading, came to
see me; and understanding how I stood committed, it
was upon her also to go to the King about it. Her
father, who had been sheriff of Bristol, was hanged
near his own door for endeavouring to bring the
King in; upon which consideration she had some
hopes the King might hear her on my behalf. Accordingly,
when she returned to London, she and
Margaret Fell went to the King together; who, when
he understood whose daughter she was, received her
kindly. Her request to him being to send for me up,
and hear the cause himself, he promised her he
would; and he commanded his secretary to send an
order for bringing me up.</p>

<p>But when they came to the secretary for the order
he said it was not in his power; he must go according
to law; and I must be brought up by a writ of habeas
corpus before the judges. So he wrote to the Judge
of the King's Bench, signifying that it was the King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
pleasure I should be sent up by a writ of habeas
corpus. Accordingly a writ was sent and delivered
to the sheriff; but because it was directed to the
chancellor of Lancaster the sheriff put it off to him;
on the other hand, the chancellor would not make the
warrant upon it, but said the sheriff must do that.</p>

<p>At length both chancellor and sheriff were got together;
but being both enemies to Truth, they sought
occasion for delay, and found an error in the writ,
which was that, being directed to the chancellor, it
said, "George Fox in prison under <em>your</em> custody,"
whereas the prison I was in was not in the chancellor's
custody, but the sheriff's; so the word <em>your</em>
should have been <em>his</em>. Upon this they returned the
writ to London again, only to have that one word altered.</p>

<p>When it was altered and brought down again, the
sheriff refused to carry me up unless I would seal a
writing to him and become bound to pay for the sealing
and the charge of carrying me up: which I denied,
telling them I would not seal anything.</p>

<p>I was moved also to write to the King to exhort
him to exercise mercy and forgiveness towards his
enemies and to warn him to restrain the profaneness
and looseness that was risen up in the nation upon his
return.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"TO THE KING.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">King Charles</span>:</p>

<p>"Thou camest not into this nation by sword, nor
by victory of war, but by the power of the Lord.
Now, if thou dost not live in this power, thou wilt
not prosper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the Lord hath showed thee mercy and forgiven
thee, and thou dost not show mercy and forgive, God
will not hear thy prayers, nor them that pray for
thee. If thou dost not stop persecution and persecutors,
and take away all laws that hold up persecution
about religion; if thou persist in them, and uphold
persecution, that will make thee as blind as those
that have gone before thee: for persecution hath always
blinded those that have gone into it. Such God
by his power overthrows, doeth His valiant acts
upon, and bringeth salvation to His oppressed ones.</p>

<p>"If thou bear the sword in vain, and let drunkenness,
oaths, plays, May-games, as setting up of May-poles,
with the image of the crown atop of them, with
such like abominations and vanities, be encouraged or
go unpunished, the nation will quickly turn like
Sodom and Gomorrah, and be as bad as those men of
the old world, who grieved the Lord till He overthrew
them. So He will overthrow you if these
things be not suppressed.</p>

<p>"Hardly ever before has there been so much wickedness
at liberty as there is at this day, as though
there were no terror nor sword of magistracy. Such
looseness doth not grace a government, nor please
them that do well. Our prayers are for them that
are in authority, that under them we may live a
godly life in peace, and that we may not be brought
into ungodliness by them. Hear and consider, and
do good in thy time, whilst thou hast power; be merciful
and forgive; that is the way to overcome and
obtain the kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>It was long before the sheriff would yield to remove
me to London unless I would seal a bond to
him, and bear the charges; which I still refused to
do. Then they consulted how to convey me up, and
first concluded to send up a party of horse with me. I
told them, "If I were such a man as you have represented
me to be, you would have need to send a troop
or two of horse to guard me."</p>

<p>When they considered what a charge it would
be to them to send up a party of horse with me, they
altered their purpose, and concluded to send me up
guarded only by the jailer and some bailiffs. But
upon farther consideration they found that this
also would be a great charge to them, and therefore
they sent for me to the jailer's house, and told me
that if I would put in bail that I would be in London
on such a day of the term, I should have leave to
go up with some of my own friends.</p>

<p>I told them I would neither put in bail, nor give
one piece of silver to the jailer; for I was an innocent
man,&mdash;that they had imprisoned me wrongfully,
and laid a false charge upon me. Nevertheless, I
said, if they would let me go up with one or two of
my friends to bear me company, I might go up and
be in London on such a day, if the Lord should permit;
and if they desired it, I or any of my friends
that went with me would carry up their charge
against myself.</p>

<p>When they saw they could do no otherwise with
me, the sheriff consented that I should come up with
some of my friends, without any other engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
than my word, to appear before the judges at London
such a day of the term, if the Lord should permit.</p>

<p>Thereupon I was let out of prison, and went to
Swarthmore, where I stayed two or three days; and
thence went to Lancaster, and so to Preston, having
meetings amongst Friends till I came into Cheshire,
to William Gandy's, where was a large meeting without
doors, the house not being sufficient to contain
it. That day the Lord's everlasting Seed, which is
the heir of the promise, was set over all, and Friends
were turned to it.</p>

<p>Thence I came into Staffordshire and Warwickshire,
to Anthony Bickliff's, and at Nuneaton,<a name="FNanchor_AK_162" id="FNanchor_AK_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_162" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> at a
priest's widow's house, we had a blessed meeting,
wherein the everlasting Word of life was powerfully
declared, and many were settled in it. Then, travelling
on, visiting Friends' meetings, in about three
weeks' time from my coming out of prison I reached
London, Richard Hubberthorn and Robert Withers
being with me.</p>

<p>When we came to Charing-Cross, multitudes of
people were gathered together to see the burning of
the bowels of some of the old King's judges, who had
been hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>

<p>We went next morning to Judge Mallet's chamber.
He was putting on his red gown to sit in judgment
upon some more of the King's judges. He was then
very peevish and froward, and said I might come another
time.</p>

<p>We went again to his chamber when there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
with him Judge Foster, who was called the Lord
Chief-Justice of England. With me was one called
Esquire Marsh, who was one of the bedchamber to
the King. When we had delivered to the judges the
charge that was against me, and they had read to
those words, "that I and my friends were embroiling
the nation in blood," etc., they struck their hands
on the table. Whereupon I told them that I was the
man whom that charge was against, but I was as innocent
of any such thing as a new-born child, and had
brought it up myself; and some of my friends came
up with me, without any guard.</p>

<p>As yet they had not minded my hat, but now seeing
it on, they said, "What, do you stand with your
hat on!" I told them I did not so in any contempt
of them. Then they commanded it to be taken off;
and when they called for the marshal of the King's
Bench, they said to him, "You must take this man
and secure him; but let him have a chamber, and not
be put amongst the prisoners."</p>

<p>"My lord," said the marshal, "I have no chamber
to put him into; my house is so full I cannot tell
where to provide a room for him but amongst the
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the judge, "you must not put him
amongst the prisoners."</p>

<p>But when the marshal still answered that he had
no other place wherein to put me, Judge Foster said
to me, "Will you appear to-morrow about ten o'clock
at the King's Bench bar in Westminster-Hall?"</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, if the Lord gives me strength."</p>

<p>Then said Judge Foster to the other judge, "If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
says Yes, and promises it, you may take his word;"
so I was dismissed.</p>

<p>Next day I appeared at the King's Bench bar at
the hour appointed, Robert Widders, Richard Hubberthorn,
and Esquire Marsh going with me. I was
brought into the middle of the court; and as soon as
I came in, was moved to look round, and, turning
to the people, say, "Peace be among you." The
power of the Lord spread over the court.</p>

<p>The charge against me was read openly. The people
were moderate, and the judges cool and loving;
and the Lord's mercy was to them. But when they
came to that part which said that I and my friends
were embroiling the nation in blood, and raising a
new war, and that I was an enemy to the King, etc.,
they lifted up their hands.</p>

<p>Then, stretching out my arms, I said, "I am the
man whom that charge is against; but I am as innocent
as a child concerning the charge, and have never
learned any war-postures. And," said I, "do ye
think that, if I and my friends had been such men as
the charge declares, I would have brought it up myself
against myself? Or that I should have been suffered
to come up with only one or two of my friends
with me? Had I been such a man as this charge sets
forth, I had need to be guarded with a troop or two
of horse. But the sheriff and magistrates of Lancashire
thought fit to let me and my friends come up
with it ourselves, nearly two hundred miles, without
any guard at all; which, ye may be sure, they would
not have done, had they looked upon me to be such a
man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Judge asked me whether it should be
filed, or what I would do with it. I answered, "Ye
are judges, and able, I hope, to judge in this matter;
therefore, do with it what ye will; for I am the man
these charges are against, and here ye see I have
brought them up myself. Do ye what ye will with
them; I leave it to you."</p>

<p>Then, Judge Twisden beginning to speak some
angry words, I appealed to Judge Foster and Judge
Mallet, who had heard me over-night. Thereupon
they said they did not accuse me, for they had nothing
against me. Then stood up Esquire Marsh, who
was of the King's bedchamber, and told the judges
it was the King's pleasure that I should be set at liberty,
seeing no accuser came up against me. They
asked me whether I would put it to the King and
Council. I said, "Yes, with a good will."</p>

<p>Thereupon they sent the sheriff's return, which
he had made to the writ of habeas corpus, containing
the matter charged against me in the mittimus, to the
King, that he might see for what I was committed.
The return of the sheriff of Lancaster was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By virtue of His Majesty's writ, to me directed,
and hereunto annexed, I certify that before the receipt
of the said writ George Fox, in the said writ
mentioned, was committed to His Majesty's jail at
the Castle of Lancaster, in my custody, by a warrant
from Henry Porter, Esq., one of His Majesty's justices
of peace within the county palatine aforesaid,
bearing date the fifth of June now last past; for that
he, the said George Fox, was generally suspected to
be a common disturber of the peace of this nation, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
enemy of our sovereign lord the King, and a chief
upholder of the Quakers' sect; and that he, together
with others of his fanatic opinion, have of late endeavoured
to make insurrections in these parts of the
country, and to embroil the whole kingdom in blood.
And this is the cause of his taking and detaining.
Nevertheless, the body of the said George Fox I have
ready before Thomas Mallet, knight, one of His
Majesty's justices, assigned to hold pleas before His
Majesty, at his chamber in Sergeants' Inn, in Fleet
Street, to do and receive those things which his Majesty's
said justice shall determine concerning him in
this behalf, as by the aforesaid writ is required.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">George Chetham</span>, Esq., Sheriff."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On perusal of this, and consideration of the whole
matter, the King, being satisfied of my innocency,
commanded his secretary to send an order to Judge
Mallet for my release, which he did thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is his Majesty's pleasure that you give order
for releasing, and setting at full liberty the person
of George Fox, late a prisoner in Lancaster jail, and
commanded hither by an habeas corpus. And this
signification of his Majesty's pleasure shall be your
sufficient warrant. Dated at Whitehall, the 24th of
October, 1660.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Edward Nicholas.</span>"
</p>

<p>
"For Sir Thomas Mallet, knight, one<br />
of the justices of the King's Bench."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When this order was delivered to Judge Mallet,
he forthwith sent his warrant to the marshal of the
King's Bench for my release; which warrant was thus
worded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By virtue of a warrant which this morning I
have received from the Right Honorable Sir Edward
Nicholas, knight, one of his Majesty's principal secretaries,
for the releasing and setting at liberty of
George Fox, late a prisoner in Lancaster jail, and
thence brought hither by habeas corpus, and yesterday
committed unto your custody; I do hereby require
you accordingly to release and set the said prisoner
George Fox at liberty: for which this shall be
your warrant and discharge. Given under my hand
the 25th day of October, in the year of our Lord God
1660.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">Thomas Mallet.</span>"
</p>

<p class="hanging">
"To Sir John Lenthal, knight,<br />
marshal of the King's Bench,<br />
or his deputy."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, after I had been a prisoner somewhat more
than twenty weeks, I was freely set at liberty by the
King's command, the Lord's power having wonderfully
wrought for the clearing of my innocency, and
Porter, who committed me, not daring to appear to
make good the charge he had falsely suggested
against me. But, after it was known I was discharged,
a company of envious, wicked spirits were
troubled, and terror took hold of Justice Porter; for
he was afraid I would take the advantage of the law
against him for my wrong imprisonment, and thereby
undo him, his wife and children. And indeed I was
pressed by some in authority to make him and the
rest examples; but I said I should leave them to the
Lord; if the Lord forgave them I should not trouble
myself with them.</p>

<h3>1661-1662.</h3>


<p>Now did I see the end of the travail which I had
in my sore exercise at Reading;<a name="FNanchor_126_163" id="FNanchor_126_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_163" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> for the everlasting
power of the Lord was over all, and His blessed Truth,
life, and light shined over the nation. Great and
glorious meetings we had, and very quiet; and many
flocked unto the Truth. Richard Hubberthorn had
been with the King, who said that none should molest
us so long as we lived peaceably, and promised this
upon the word of a king; telling Richard that we
might make use of his promise.<a name="FNanchor_127_164" id="FNanchor_127_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_164" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Some Friends were also admitted in the House of
Lords, to declare their reasons why they could not
pay tithes, swear, go to the steeple-house worship, or
join with others in worship; and the Lords heard
them moderately. There being about seven hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Friends in prison, who had been committed under
Oliver's and Richard's government, upon contempts
(so called) when the King came in, he set them all at
liberty.</p>

<p>There seemed at that time an inclination and intention
in the government to grant Friends liberty,
because those in authority were sensible that we had
suffered as well as they under the former powers.
But still, when anything was going forward in order
thereto, some dirty spirits or other,<a name="FNanchor_128_165" id="FNanchor_128_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_165" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> that would seem
to be for us, threw something in the way to stop it.
It was said there was an instrument drawn up for
confirming our liberty, and that it only wanted signing;
when suddenly that wicked attempt of the Fifth-monarchy
people broke out, and put the city and nation
in an uproar. This was on a First-day night,
and very glorious meetings we had had that day,
wherein the Lord's Truth shone over all, and His
power was exalted above all; but about midnight, or
soon after, the drums beat, and the cry was, "Arm,
Arm!"</p>

<p>I got up out of bed, and in the morning took boat,
and, landing at Whitehall-stairs, walked through
Whitehall. The people there looked strangely at me,
but I passed through them, and went to Pall-Mall,
where divers Friends came to me, though it had now
become dangerous to pass through the streets; for by
this time the city and suburbs were up in arms. Exceedingly
rude the people and soldiers were. Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Fell, going to a Friend's house, was knocked, down by
the soldiers, and he would have been killed had not
the Duke of York come by.</p>

<p>Great mischief was done in the city this week; and
when the next First-day came, as Friends went to
their meetings, many were taken prisoners. I stayed
at Pall-Mall, intending to be at the meeting there;
but on Seventh-day night a company of troopers
came and knocked at the door. The servant let them
in. They rushed into the house, and laid hold of me;
and, there being amongst them one that had served
under the Parliament, he put his hand to my pocket
and asked whether I had any pistol. I told him,
"You know I do not carry pistols; why, therefore,
ask such a question of me, whom you know to be a
peaceable man?"</p>

<p>Others of the soldiers ran into the chambers, and
there found in bed Esquire Marsh, who, though he
was one of the King's bedchamber, out of his love to
me came and lodged where I did. When they came
down again they said, "Why should we take this man
away with us. We will let him alone."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Parliament soldier, "he is one of
the heads, and a chief ringleader."</p>

<p>Upon this the soldiers were taking me away, but
Esquire Marsh, hearing of it, sent for him that commanded
the party, and desired him to let me alone,
for he would see me forthcoming in the morning.</p>

<p>In the morning, before they could fetch me, and
before the meeting was gathered, there came a company
of foot soldiers to the house, and one of them,
drawing his sword, held it over my head. I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
him why he drew his sword at an unarmed man, at
which his fellows, being ashamed, bade him put up his
sword.</p>

<p>These foot soldiers took me away to Whitehall
before the troopers came for me.</p>

<p>As I was going out several Friends were coming in
to the meeting. I commended their boldness and
cheerfulness, and encouraged them to persevere
therein.</p>

<p>When I was brought to Whitehall, the soldiers
and people were exceedingly rude, yet I declared
Truth to them. But some great persons came by,
who were very full of envy. "Why," said they, "do
ye let him preach? Put him into a place where he
may not stir."</p>

<p>So into such a place they put me, and the soldiers
watched over me. I told them that, though they
could confine my body and shut that up, yet they
could not stop the Word of life. Some came and
asked me what I was. I told them, "A preacher of
righteousness."</p>

<p>After I had been kept there two or three hours,
Esquire Marsh spoke to Lord Gerrard, and he came
and bade them set me at liberty. The marshal, when
I was discharged, demanded fees. I told him I could
not give him any, neither was it our practice; and I
asked him how he could demand fees of me, who was
innocent.</p>

<p>Then I went through the guards, the Lord's power
being over them; and, after I had declared Truth to
the soldiers, I went up the streets with two Irish
colonels that came from Whitehall to an inn where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
many Friends were at that time prisoners under a
guard. I desired these colonels to speak to the guard
to let me go in to visit my friends that were prisoners
there; but they would not. Then I stepped up to the
sentry, and desired him to let me go up; and he did
so.</p>

<p>While I was there the soldiers went again to Pall-Mall
to search for me; but not finding me they turned
towards the inn, and bade all come out that were not
prisoners; so they went out. But I asked the soldiers
that were within whether I might not stay there a
while with my friends. They said, "Yes." I stayed,
and so escaped their hands again. Towards night I
went to Pall-Mall, to see how it was with the Friends
there; and, after I had stayed a while, I went up into
the city.</p>

<p>Great rifling of houses there was at this time to
search for people. I went to a private Friend's
house, and Richard Hubberthorn was with me.
There we drew up a declaration against plots and
fightings, to be presented to the King and Council;
but when finished, and sent to print, it was taken in
the press.</p>

<p>On this insurrection of the Fifth-monarchy men,
great havoc was made both in city and country, so
that it was dangerous for sober people to stir abroad
for several weeks after. Men or women could hardly
go up and down the streets to buy provisions for their
families without being abused. In the country they
dragged men and women out of their houses, and
some sick men out of their beds by the legs. Nay,
one man in a fever, the soldiers dragged out of bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to prison, and when he was brought there he died.
His name was Thomas Pachyn.</p>

<p>Margaret Fell went to the King and told him what
sad work there was in the city and nation, and showed
him we were an innocent, peaceable people, and that
we must keep our meetings as heretofore, whatever
we suffered; but that it concerned him to see that
peace was kept, that no innocent blood might be shed.</p>

<p>The prisons were now everywhere filled with
Friends and others, in the city and country, and the
posts were so laid for the searching of letters that
none could pass unsearched. We heard of several
thousands of our Friends that were cast into prison
in several parts of the nation, and Margaret Fell carried
an account of them to the King and Council.
The next week we had an account of several thousands
more that were cast into prison, and she went
and laid them also before the King and Council.
They wondered how we could have such intelligence,
seeing they had given such strict charge for the intercepting
of all letters; but the Lord did so order it that
we had an account notwithstanding all their stoppings.<a name="FNanchor_129_166" id="FNanchor_129_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_166" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Soon after the King gave forth a proclamation
that no soldiers should search any house without a
constable. But the jails were still full, many thousands
of Friends being in prison; which mischief was
occasioned by the wicked rising of the Fifth-monarchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
men. But when those that were taken came
to be executed, they did us the justice to clear us
openly from having any hand in or knowledge of
their plot.</p>

<p>After that, the King being continually importuned
thereunto, issued a declaration that Friends should
be set at liberty without paying fees. But great labour,
travail, and pains were taken before this was
obtained; for Thomas Moore and Margaret Fell went
often to the King about it.</p>

<p>Much blood was shed this year, many of the old
King's judges being hung, drawn and quartered.
Amongst them that so suffered, Colonel Hacker was
one. He had sent me prisoner from Leicester to London
in Oliver's time, of which an account is given before.
A sad day it was, and a repaying of blood with
blood. For in the time of Oliver Cromwell, when
several men were put to death by him, being hung,
drawn and quartered for pretended treasons, I felt
from the Lord God that their blood would be required;
and I said as much then to several.</p>

<p>And now, upon the King's return, several that had
been against him were put to death, as the others that
were for him had been before by Oliver. This was
sad work, destroying people; contrary to the nature
of Christians, who have the nature of lambs and
sheep. But there was a secret hand in bringing this
day upon that hypocritical generation of professors,
who, being got into power, grew proud, haughty, and
cruel beyond others, and persecuted the people of
God without pity.</p>

<p>When Friends were under cruel persecutions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
sufferings in the Commonwealth's time, I was moved
of the Lord to write to Friends to draw up accounts
of their sufferings, and lay them before the justices at
their sessions; and if they would not do justice, then
to lay them before the judges at the assize; and if
they would not do justice, then to lay them before
the Parliament, the Protector and his Council, that
they might all see what was done under their government;
and if they would not do justice, then to lay it
before the Lord, who would hear the cries of the oppressed,
and of the widows and fatherless whom they
had made so.</p>

<p>For that for which we suffered, and for which our
goods were spoiled, was our obedience to the Lord in
His Power and His Spirit. He was able to help and
to succour, and we had no helper in the earth but
Him. And He heard the cries of His people, and
brought an overflowing scourge over the heads of all
our persecutors, which brought a dread and a fear
amongst and on them all. So that those who had
nicknamed us (who are the children of Light) and in
scorn called us Quakers, the Lord made to quake;
and many of them would have been glad to hide themselves
amongst us; and some of them, through the
distress that came upon them, did at length come to
confess to the Truth.</p>

<p>Many ways were these professors warned, by word,
by writing, and by signs; but they would believe none
till it was too late. William Sympson was moved of
the Lord to go at several times for three years naked
and barefooted before them, as a sign to them, in
markets, courts, towns, cities, to priests' houses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
to great men's houses, telling them, "So shall ye be
stripped naked as I am stripped naked!" And sometimes
he was moved to put on hair-sackcloth, and to
besmear his face, and to tell them, "So will the Lord
God besmear all your religion as I am besmeared."</p>

<p>Great sufferings did that poor man undergo, sore
whippings with horse-whips and coach-whips on his
bare body, grievous stoning and imprisonments, in
three years' time, before the King came in, that they
might have taken warning; but they would not, and
rewarded his love with cruel usage. Only the mayor
of Cambridge did nobly to him, for he put his gown
about him and took him into his house.</p>

<p>Another Friend, Robert Huntingdon, was moved
of the Lord to go into Carlisle steeple-house with a
white sheet about him, amongst the great Presbyterians
and Independents there, to show them that
the surplice was coming up again; and he put an
halter about his neck to show them that an halter was
coming upon them; which was fulfilled upon some of
our persecutors not long after.</p>

<p>Another, Richard Sale, living near Westchester,
being constable of the place where he lived, had sent
to him with a pass a Friend whom those wicked professors
had taken up for a vagabond, because he travelled
up and down in the work of the ministry. This
constable, being convinced by the Friend thus
brought to him, gave him his pass and liberty, and
was afterwards himself cast into prison.</p>

<p>After this, on a lecture-day, Richard Sale was
moved to go to the steeple-house in the time of their
worship, and to carry those persecuting priests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
people a lantern and candle, as a figure of their darkness.
But they cruelly abused him, and like dark
professors as they were put him into their prison
called Little Ease, and so squeezed his body therein
that not long after he died.<a name="FNanchor_130_167" id="FNanchor_130_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_167" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Although those Friends that had been imprisoned
on the rising of the Fifth-monarchy men were set at
liberty, meetings were much disturbed, and great sufferings
Friends underwent. For besides what was
done by officers and soldiers, many wild fellows and
rude people often came in.</p>

<p>One time when I was at Pall-Mall there came an
ambassador with a company of Irishmen and rude fellows.
The meeting was over before they came, and I
was gone into a chamber, where I heard one of them
say that he would kill all the Quakers. I went down
to him, and was moved in the power of the Lord to
speak to him. I told him, "The law said, 'An eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth'; but thou threateneth
to kill all the Quakers, though they have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
thee no hurt. But," said I, "here is gospel for thee:
here is my hair, here is my cheek, and here is my
shoulder," turning it to him.</p>

<p>This so overcame him that he and his companions
stood as men amazed, and said that if that was our
principle, and if we were as we said, they never saw
the like in their lives. I told them that what I was in
words, I also was in my life. Then the ambassador,
who stood without, came in; for he said that this Irish
colonel was a desperate man that he durst not come in
with him for fear he should do us some mischief. But
Truth came over the Irish colonel, and he carried
himself lovingly towards us; as also did the ambassador;
for the Lord's power was over them all.</p>

<p>At Mile-End Friends were kept out of their meeting-place
by soldiers, but they stood nobly in the
Truth, valiant for the Lord's name; and at last the
Truth gave them dominion.</p>

<p>About this time we had an account that John
Love, a Friend that was moved to go and bear testimony
against the idolatry of the Papists, was dead in
prison at Rome; it was suspected he was privately put
to death. Also before this time we received account
from New England that the government there had
made a law to banish the Quakers out of their colonies,
upon pain of death in case they returned; that
several of our Friends, having been so banished and
returning, were thereupon taken and actually hanged,
and that divers more were in prison, in danger of the
like sentence being executed upon them. When
those were put to death I was in prison at Lancaster,
and had a perfect sense of their sufferings as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
it had been myself, and as though the halter had been
put about my own neck, though we had not at that
time heard of it.<a name="FNanchor_131_168" id="FNanchor_131_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_168" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>As soon as we heard of it, Edward Burrough went
to the King and told him that there was a vein of
innocent blood opened in his dominions which, if it
were not stopped, would overrun all. To this the
King replied, "But I will stop that vein." Edward
Burrough said, "Then do it speedily, for we know
not how many may soon be put to death." The King
answered, "As speedily as ye will. Call," (said he to
some present) "the secretary, and I will do it presently."</p>

<p>The secretary being called, a mandamus was forthwith
granted. A day or two after, Edward Burrough
going again to the King to desire the matter might be
expedited, the King said he had no occasion at present
to send a ship thither, but if we would send one we
might do it as soon as we would. Edward then asked
the King if it would please him to grant his deputation
to one called a Quaker to carry the mandamus to
New England. He said, "Yes, to whom ye will."</p>

<p>Whereupon Edward Burrough named Samuel
Shattuck, who, being an inhabitant of New England,
was banished by their law, to be hanged if he came
again; and to him the deputation was granted. Then
he sent for Ralph Goldsmith, an honest Friend, who
was master of a good ship, and agreed with him for
three hundred pounds (goods or no goods) to sail in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
ten days. He forthwith prepared to set sail, and with
a prosperous gale, in about six weeks' time, arrived
before the town of Boston in New England, upon a
First-day morning.</p>

<p>With him went many passengers, both of New
and Old England, Friends, whom the Lord moved to
go to bear their testimony against those bloody persecutors,
who had exceeded all the world in that age
in their bloody persecutions.</p>

<p>The townsmen at Boston, seeing a ship come into
the bay with English colours, soon came on board and
asked for the captain. Ralph Goldsmith told them
he was the commander. They asked him if he had
any letters. He said, "Yes." They asked if he
would deliver them. He said, "No; not to-day."</p>

<p>So they went ashore and reported that there was a
ship full of Quakers, and that Samuel Shattuck, who
they knew was by their law to be put to death if he
came again after banishment, was among them, but
they knew not his errand nor his authority.</p>

<p>So all were kept close that day, and none of the
ship's company suffered to go on shore. Next morning
Samuel Shattuck, the King's deputy, and Ralph
Goldsmith, went on shore, and, sending back to the
ship the men that landed them, they two went
through the town to Governor John Endicott's door,
and knocked. He sent out a man to know their business.
They sent him word that their business was
from the King of England, and that they would deliver
their message to no one but the Governor himself.</p>

<p>Thereupon they were admitted, and the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
came to them; and having received the deputation
and the mandamus, he put off his hat and looked upon
them. Then, going out, he bade the Friends follow
him. He went to the deputy-governor, and after a
short consultation came out to the Friends, and said,
"We shall obey his majesty's commands."</p>

<p>After this the master gave liberty to the passengers
to come on shore, and presently the noise of the
business flew about the town; and the Friends of the
town and the passengers of the ship met together to
offer up their praises and thanksgivings to God, who
had so wonderfully delivered them from the teeth of
the devourer.</p>

<p>While they were thus met, in came a poor Friend,
who, being sentenced by their bloody law to die, had
lain some time in irons expecting execution. This
added to their joy, and caused them to lift up their
hearts in high praise to God, who is worthy for ever
to have the praise, the glory, and the honour; for He
only is able to deliver, to save, and support all that
sincerely put their trust in Him. Here follows a
copy of the mandamus.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p>"Trusty and well-beloved, We greet you well.
Having been informed that several of our subjects
amongst you, called Quakers, have been and are imprisoned
by you, whereof some have been executed,
and others (as hath been represented unto us) are in
danger to undergo the like, we have thought fit to
signify our pleasure in that behalf for the future; and
do hereby require that if there be any of those people
called Quakers amongst you, now already condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
to suffer death or other corporal punishment, or that
are imprisoned and obnoxious to the like condemnation,
you are to forbear to proceed any further
therein; but that you forthwith send the said persons
(whether condemned or imprisoned) over into this
our kingdom of England, together with the respective
crimes or offences laid to their charge, to the end
that such course may be taken with them here as
shall be agreeable to our laws and their demerits.
And for so doing, these our letters shall be your sufficient
warrant and discharge. Given at our court at
Whitehall the ninth day of September, 1661, in the
13th year of our reign."</p>

<p>Subscribed: "To our trusty and well-beloved
John Endicott, Esquire, and to all and every other
the Governor or governors of our plantations of
New England, and of all the colonies thereunto belonging,
that now are or hereafter shall be, and to all
and every the ministers and officers of our plantations
and colonies whatsoever within the continent of
New England.</p>

<p class="signature">
"By his majesty's command,<br />
"<span class="smcap">William Morris</span>."<a name="FNanchor_132_169" id="FNanchor_132_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_169" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>
<p>Some time after this several New England magistrates
came over, with one of their priests. We had
several discourses with them concerning their murdering
our Friends, the servants of the Lord; but
they were ashamed to stand to their bloody actions.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions I asked Simon Broadstreet,
one of the New England magistrates, whether
he had not had a hand in putting to death those four
servants of God, whom they hung only for being
Quakers, as they had nicknamed them. He confessed
that he had. I then asked him and the rest of
his associates that were present whether they would
acknowledge themselves to be subject to the laws of
England; and if they did, by what laws they had put
our Friends to death. They said they were subject
to the laws of England, and had put our Friends to
death by the same law that the Jesuits were put to
death in England.</p>

<p>I asked them then whether they believed those
Friends of ours whom they had put to death were
Jesuits or jesuitically affected. They said, "Nay."
"Then," said I, "ye have murdered them, if ye have
put them to death by the law by which Jesuits are
put to death here in England, and yet confess they
were no Jesuits. By this it plainly appears ye have
put them to death in your own wills, without any
law."</p>

<p>Then Simon Broadstreet, finding himself and his
company ensnared by their own words, asked if we
came to catch them. I told them they had caught
themselves, and might justly be questioned for their
lives; and if the father of William Robinson, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
them that were put to death, were in town, it was
probable he would question them, and bring their
lives into jeopardy.</p>

<p>Here they began to excuse themselves, saying,
"There is no persecution now amongst us." But
next morning we had letters from New England telling
us that our Friends were persecuted there afresh.
We went again and showed them our letters, which
put them both to silence and to shame; and in great
fear they seemed to be lest some one should call
them to account and prosecute them for their lives.
Especially was Simon Broadstreet fearful; for he had
before so many witnesses confessed that he had a
hand in putting our Friends to death, that he could
not get off from it; though he afterwards through
fear shuffled, and would have unsaid it again. After
this, he and the rest soon returned to New England
again.</p>

<p>I went also to Governor Winthrop, and discoursed
with him on these matters. He assured me that he
had no hand in putting our Friends to death, or in
any way persecuting them; but was one of them that
protested against it.</p>

<p>About this time I lost a very good book, being
taken in the printer's hands; it was a useful teaching
work, containing the signification and explanation of
names, parables, types, and figures in the Scriptures.
They who took it were so affected with it, that they
were loth to destroy it; but thinking to make a great
advantage of it, they would have let us have it again,
if we would have given them a great sum of money
for it; which we were not free to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this, while I was prisoner in Lancaster Castle,
the book called the "Battledore" was published,
which was written to show that in all languages Thou
and Thee is the proper and usual form of speech to a
single person; and You to more than one. This was
set forth in examples or instances taken from the
Scriptures, and books of teaching, in about thirty
languages. J. Stubbs and Benjamin Furly took great
pains in compiling it, which I set them upon; and
some things I added to it.<a name="FNanchor_133_170" id="FNanchor_133_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_170" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>
<p>When it was finished, copies were presented to the
King and his Council, to the Bishops of Canterbury
and London, and to the two universities one each;
and many purchased them. The King said it was the
proper language of all nations; and the Bishop of
Canterbury, being asked what he thought of it, was
at a stand, and could not tell what to say to it. For
it did so inform and convince people, that few afterwards
were so rugged toward us for saying Thou and
Thee to a single person, for which before they were
exceedingly fierce against us.</p>

<p>Thou and Thee was a sore cut to proud flesh, and
them that sought self-honour, who, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
would say it to God and Christ, could not endure to
have it said to themselves. So that we were often
beaten and abused, and sometimes in danger of our
lives, for using those words to some proud men, who
would say, "What! you ill-bred clown, do you Thou
me?" as though Christian breeding consisted in saying
You to one; which is contrary to all their grammars
and teaching books, by which they instructed
their youth.</p>

<p>About this time many Papists and Jesuits began
to fawn upon Friends, and talked up and down where
they came, that of all the sects the Quakers were the
best and most self-denying people; and they said it
was great pity that they did not return to the Holy
Mother Church. Thus they made a buzz among the
people, and said they would willingly discourse with
Friends. But Friends were loth to meddle with
them, because they were Jesuits, looking upon it to
be both dangerous and scandalous.</p>

<p>But when I understood it, I said to Friends, "Let
us discourse with them, be they what they will." So
a time being appointed at Gerrard Roberts's, there
came two of them like courtiers. They asked our
names, which we told them; but we did not ask their
names, for we understood they were called Papists,
and they knew we were called Quakers.</p>

<p>I asked them the same question that I had formerly
asked a Jesuit, namely, whether the Church
of Rome was not degenerated from the Church in
the primitive times, from the Spirit, power, and practice
that they were in in the Apostles' times? He to
whom I put this question, being subtle, said he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
not answer it. I asked him why. But he would show
no reason. His companion said he would answer me;
and said that they were not degenerated from the
Church in the primitive times. I asked the other
whether he was of the same mind. He said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Then I replied that, for the better understanding
one of another, and that there might be no mistake, I
would repeat my question over again after this manner:
"Is the Church of Rome now in the same
purity, practice, power, and Spirit that the Church
in the Apostles' time was in?" When they saw we
would be exact with them, they flew off and denied
that, saying it was presumption in any to say they
had the same power and Spirit which the Apostles
had.</p>

<p>I told them it was presumption in them to meddle
with the words of Christ and His Apostles, and make
people believe they succeeded the Apostles, yet be
forced to confess they were not in the same power
and Spirit that the Apostles were in. "This," said
I, "is a spirit of presumption, and rebuked by the
Apostles' spirit."</p>

<p>I showed them how different their fruits and practices
were from the fruits and practices of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Then got up one of them, and said, "Ye are a
company of dreamers." "Nay," said I, "ye are the
filthy dreamers, who dream ye are the Apostles' successors,
and yet confess ye have not the same power
and Spirit which the Apostles were in. And are not
they defilers of the flesh who say it is presumption
for any to say they have the same power and Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
which the Apostles had? Now," said I, "if ye have
not the same power and Spirit which the Apostles
had, then it is manifest that ye are led by another
power and spirit than that by which the Apostles
and Church in the primitive times were led."</p>

<p>Then I began to tell them how that evil spirit by
which they were led had led them to pray by beads
and to images, and to set up nunneries, friaries, and
monasteries, and to put people to death for religion;
which practices I showed them were below the law,
and far short of the gospel, in which is liberty.</p>

<p>They were soon weary of this discourse, and went
their way, and gave a charge, as we heard, to the
Papists, that they should not dispute with us, nor
read any of our books.</p>

<p>So we were rid of them; but we had reasonings
with all the other sects, Presbyterians, Independents,
Seekers, Baptists, Episcopal men, Socinians, Brownists,
Lutherans, Calvinists, Arminians, Fifth-monarchy
men, Familists, Muggletonians, and Ranters;
none of which would affirm that they had the same
power and Spirit that the Apostles had and were in;
so in that power and Spirit the Lord gave us
dominion over them all.</p>

<p>As for the Fifth-monarchy men I was moved to
give forth a paper, to manifest their error to them;
for they looked for Christ's personal coming in an
outward form and manner, and fixed the time to the
year 1666; at which time some of them prepared
themselves when it thundered and rained, thinking
Christ was then come to set up His kingdom, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
they imagined they were to kill the whore without
them.</p>

<p>But I told them that the whore was alive in them,
and was not burned with God's fire, nor judged in
them with the same power and Spirit the Apostles
were in; and that their looking for Christ's coming
outwardly to set up His kingdom was like the Pharisees'
"Lo here," and "Lo there." But Christ was
come, and had set up His kingdom above sixteen hundred
years ago, according to Nebuchadnezzar's dream
and Daniel's prophecy, and He had dashed to pieces
the four monarchies, the great image, with its head
of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of
brass, legs of iron, and its feet part of iron part of
clay; and they were all blown away with God's wind,
as the chaff in the summer threshing-floor.</p>

<p>And I told them that when Christ was on earth,
He said His kingdom was not of this world; if it had
been, His servants would have fought; but it was
not, therefore His servants did not fight. Therefore
all the Fifth-monarchy men that are fighters with
carnal weapons are none of Christ's servants, but the
beast's and the whore's. Christ said, "All power in
heaven and in earth is given to me"; so then His
kingdom was set up above sixteen hundred years ago,
and He reigns. "And we see Jesus Christ reign,"
said the Apostle, "and He shall reign till all things
be put under His feet"; though all things are not
yet put under His feet, nor subdued.</p>

<p>This year several Friends were moved to go
beyond the seas, to publish Truth in foreign countries.
John Stubbs, and Henry Fell, and Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Costrop were moved to go towards China and Prester
John's country; but no masters of ships would carry
them.<a name="FNanchor_134_171" id="FNanchor_134_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_171" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> With much ado they got a warrant from the
King; but the East India Company found ways to
avoid it, and the masters of their ships would not
carry them.</p>

<p>Then they went into Holland, hoping to get passage
there, but none could they get there either. Then
John Stubbs and Henry Fell took shipping for Alexandria,
in Egypt, intending to go thence by the caravans.
Meanwhile Daniel Baker, being moved to
go to Smyrna, drew Richard Costrop, contrary to
his own freedom, to go along with him; and in the
passage, Richard falling sick, Daniel Baker left him
so in the ship, where he died; but that hard-hearted
man afterwards lost his own condition.</p>

<p>John Stubbs and Henry Fell reached Alexandria;
but they had not been long there before the English
consul banished them; yet before they came away,
they dispersed many books and papers for opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
the principles and way of Truth to the Turks and
Grecians. They gave the book called, "The Pope's
Strength Broken," to an old friar, for him to give or
send to the Pope. When the friar had perused it he
placed his hand on his breast and confessed, "What
is written therein is truth; but," said he, "if I should
confess it openly, they would burn me."</p>

<p>John Stubbs and Henry Fell, not being suffered to
go further, returned to England, and came to London
again. John had a vision that the English and
Dutch, who had joined together not to carry them,
would fall out one with the other; and so it came to
pass.</p>

<p>Among the exercises and troubles that Friends had
from without, one was concerning Friends' marriages,
which sometimes were called in question.<a name="FNanchor_135_172" id="FNanchor_135_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_172" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In
this year there happened to be a cause tried at the assize
at Nottingham concerning a Friend's marriage.</p>

<p>The case was thus: Some years before two Friends
were joined together in marriage amongst Friends,
and lived together as man and wife about two years.
Then the man died, leaving his wife with child, and
leaving an estate in lands of copyhold. When the
woman was delivered, the jury presented the child
heir to its father's lands, and accordingly the child
was admitted; afterwards another Friend married the
widow. After that a person near of kin to her former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
husband brought his action against the Friend who
had last married her, endeavoring to dispossess them,
and deprive the child of the inheritance, and to possess
himself thereof as next heir to the woman's first
husband. To effect this he endeavoured to prove the
child illegitimate, alleging that the marriage was not
according to law.</p>

<p>In opening the cause the plaintiff's counsel used
unseemly words concerning Friends, saying that
"they went together like brute beasts," with other
ill expressions. After the counsel on both sides had
pleaded, the Judge (viz., Judge Archer) took the matter
in hand, and opened it to them, telling them,
"There was a marriage in paradise when Adam took
Eve and Eve took Adam, and it was the consent of
the parties that made a marriage." And for the
Quakers, he said, he did not know their opinions; but
he did not believe they went together as brute beasts,
as had been said of them, but as Christians; and
therefore he did believe the marriage was lawful, and
the child lawful heir.</p>

<p>The better to satisfy the jury he brought them a
case to this purpose: "A man that was weak of body,
and kept his bed, had a desire in that condition to
marry, and did declare before witnesses that he did
take such a woman to be his wife, and the woman declared
that she took that man to be her husband.
This marriage was afterwards called in question, and
all the bishops did conclude it to be a lawful marriage."</p>

<p>Hereupon the jury gave in their verdict for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Friend's child against the man that would have deprived
it of its inheritance.</p>

<p>Now, there being very many Friends in prison in
the nation,<a name="FNanchor_136_173" id="FNanchor_136_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_173" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Richard Hubberthorn and I drew up
a paper concerning them, and got it delivered to the
King, that he might understand how we were dealt
with by his officers. It was directed thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">For the King</span>:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friend</span>, Who art the chief ruler of these dominions,
here is a list of some of the sufferings of the
people of God, in scorn called Quakers, that have
suffered under the changeable powers before thee,
by whom there have been imprisoned, and under
whom there have suffered for good conscience' sake,
and for bearing testimony to the truth as it is in
Jesus, three thousand one hundred and seventy-three
persons; and there lie yet in prison, in the name of
the Commonwealth, seventy-three persons, that we
know of. And there died in prison in the time of the
Commonwealth, and of Oliver and Richard the Protectors,
through cruel and hard imprisonments, upon
nasty straw and in dungeons, thirty-two persons.
There have been also imprisoned in thy name, since
thy arrival, by such as thought to ingratiate themselves
thereby with thee, three thousand sixty and
eight persons. Besides this our meetings are daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
broken up by men with clubs and arms, though we
meet peaceably, according to the practice of God's
people in the primitive times, and our Friends are
thrown into waters, and trodden upon, till the very
blood gushes out of them; the number of which
abuses can hardly be uttered.</p>

<p>"Now this we would have of thee, to set them at
liberty that lie in prison in the names of the Commonwealth,
and of the two Protectors, and them that
lie in thy own name, for speaking the truth, and for
good conscience' sake, who have not lifted up a hand
against thee or any man; and that the meetings of
our Friends, who meet peaceably together in the fear
of God, to worship Him, may not be broken up by
rude people with their clubs, swords, and staves. One
of the greatest things that we have suffered for formerly
was, because we could not swear to the Protectors
and all the changeable governments; and now
we are imprisoned because we cannot take the oath of
allegiance. Now, if our yea be not yea, and nay, nay,
to thee, and to all men upon the earth, let us suffer
as much for breaking that, as others do for breaking
an oath. We have suffered these many years, both
in lives and estates, under these changeable governments,
because we cannot swear, but obey Christ's
doctrine, who commands we should not 'swear at all,'
and this we seal with our lives and estates, with our
yea and nay, according to the doctrine of Christ.</p>

<p>"Hearken to these things, and so consider them in
the wisdom of thy God that by it such actions may be
stopped; thou that hast the government, and mayst
do it. We desire all that are in prison may be set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
at liberty, and that for the time to come they may
not be imprisoned for conscience' and for the Truth's
sake. If thou question the innocency of their sufferings,
let them and their accusers be brought before
thee, and we shall produce a more particular and full
account of their sufferings, if required."</p></blockquote>

<p class="center oldenglish">In Prison for not Swearing.</p>

<h3>1662-1665.</h3>


<p>After I had made some stay in London, and had
cleared myself of those services that at that time lay
upon me there, I went into the country, having with
me Alexander Parker and John Stubbs. We travelled
through the country, visiting Friends' meetings,
till we came to Bristol.</p>

<p>There we understood the officers were likely to
come and break up the meeting; yet on First-day we
went to the meeting at Broadmead, and Alexander
Parker standing up first, while he was speaking the
officers came and took him away. After he was gone,
I stood up and declared the everlasting Truth of the
Lord God in His eternal power, which came over all;
the meeting was quiet the rest of the time, and broke
up peaceably. I tarried till the First-day following,
visiting Friends, and being visited by them.</p>

<p>On First-day morning several Friends came to Edward
Pyot's house (where I lay the night before),
and used great endeavours to persuade me not to go
to the meeting that day, for the magistrates, they
said, had threatened to take me, and had raised the
trained bands. I wished them to go to the meeting,
not telling them what I intended to do; but I told
Edward Pyot I intended to go, and he sent his son to
show me the way from his house by the fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>As I went I met divers Friends who were coming
to me to prevent my going, and who did what they
could to stop me. "What!" said one, "wilt thou
go into the mouth of the beast?" "Wilt thou go
into the mouth of the dragon?" said another. I put
them by and went on.</p>

<p>When I came to the meeting Margaret Thomas
was speaking; and when she had done I stood up. I
saw a concern and fear upon Friends for me; but the
power of the Lord, in which I declared, soon struck
the fear out of them; life sprang, and a glorious heavenly
meeting we had.</p>

<p>After I had cleared myself of what was upon me
from the Lord to the meeting, I was moved to pray;
and after that to stand up again, and tell Friends
how they might see there was a God in Israel that
could deliver.</p>

<p>A very large meeting this was, and very hot; but
Truth was over all, the life was exalted, which carried
through all, and the meeting broke up in peace.
The officers and soldiers had been breaking up another
meeting, which had taken up their time, so
that our meeting was ended before they came. But
I understood afterwards they were in great rage because
they had missed me; for they were heard to say
one to another before, "I'll warrant we shall have
him;" but the Lord prevented them.</p>

<p>I went from the meeting to Joan Hily's, where
many Friends came to see me, rejoicing and blessing
God for our deliverance. In the evening I had a fine
fresh meeting among Friends at a Friend's house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
over the water, where we were much refreshed in the
Lord.</p>

<p>From Barnet Hills we came to Swannington, in
Leicestershire, where William Smith and some other
Friends visited me; but they went away towards
night, leaving me at a Friend's house in Swannington.</p>

<p>At night, as I was sitting in the hall speaking to
a widow woman and her daughter, Lord Beaumont
came with a company of soldiers, who, slapping their
swords on the door, rushed into the house with
swords and pistols in their hands, crying, "Put out
the candles and make fast the doors." Then they
seized upon the Friends in the house, and asked if
there were no more about the house. The Friends
told them there was one man more in the hall.</p>

<p>There being some Friends out of Derbyshire, one
of whom was named Thomas Fauks, Lord Beaumont,
after he had asked all their names, bid his man set
down that man's name as Thomas Fox. The Friend
said, Nay; that his name was not Fox, but Fauks. In
the mean time some of the soldiers came, and fetched
me out of the hall to him. He asked my name. I
told him my name was George Fox, and that I was
well known by that name. "Aye," said he, "you
are known all the world over." I said, I was known
for no hurt, but for good.</p>

<p>Then he put his hands into my pockets to search
them, and plucked out my comb-case, and afterwards
commanded one of his officers to search further for
letters. I told him I was no letter-carrier, and asked
him why he came amongst a peaceable people with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
swords and pistols without a constable, contrary to
the king's proclamation and to the late act. For he
could not say there was a meeting, I being only talking
with a poor widow-woman and her daughter.</p>

<p>By reasoning thus with him, he came somewhat
down; yet, sending for the constables, he gave them
charge of us that night, and told them to bring us
before him next morning. Accordingly the constables
set a watch of the townspeople upon us that
night, and had us next morning to his house, about
a mile from Swannington.</p>

<p>When we came before him, he told us that we had
met "contrary to the Act."<a name="FNanchor_137_174" id="FNanchor_137_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_174" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> I desired him to show
us the Act. "Why," says he, "you have it in your
pocket." I told him he did not find us in a meeting.
Then he asked whether we would take the oaths of
allegiance and supremacy. I told him I never took
any oath in my life, nor engagement, nor the covenant.
Yet still he would force the oath upon us.
I desired him to show us the oath, that we might see
whether we were the persons it was to be tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
to, and whether it was not for the discovery of popish
recusants. At length he brought a little book, but
we called for the statute-book. He would not show
us that, but caused a mittimus to be made, which
mentioned that we "were to have had a meeting."
With this mittimus he delivered us to the constables
to convey us to Leicester jail.</p>

<p>But when the constables had brought us back to
Swannington, it being harvest-time, it was hard to
get anybody to go with us. The people were loth to
take their neighbors to prison, especially in such a
busy time. They would have given us our mittimus
to carry ourselves to the jail; for it had been usual
for constables to give Friends their own mittimuses,
and they have gone themselves with them to the
jailer. But we told them that, though our Friends
had sometimes done so, we would not take this mittimus;
but some of them should go with us to the jail.</p>

<p>At last they hired a poor labouring man, who was
loth to go, though hired. So we rode to Leicester,
being five in number; some carried their Bibles open
in their hands, declaring Truth to the people as we
rode in the fields and through the towns, and telling
them we were prisoners of the Lord Jesus Christ,
going to suffer bonds for His name and Truth.
One woman Friend carried her wheel on her lap to
spin on in prison; and the people were mightily affected.</p>

<p>At Leicester we went to an inn. The master of the
house seemed troubled that we should go to the
prison; and being himself in commission, he sent for
lawyers in the town to advise with, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
taken up the mittimus, kept us in his own house, and
not have let us go into the jail.</p>

<p>But I told Friends it would be a great charge to lie
at an inn; and many Friends and people would be
coming to visit us, and it might be hard for him to
bear our having meetings in his house. Besides, we
had many Friends in the prison already, and we had
rather be with them. So we let the man know that
we were sensible of his kindness, and to prison we
went; the poor man that brought us thither delivering
both the mittimus and us to the jailer.</p>

<p>This jailer had been a very wicked, cruel man.
Six or seven Friends being in prison before we came,
he had taken some occasion to quarrel with them,
and had thrust them into the dungeon amongst the
felons, where there was hardly room for them to lie
down. We stayed all that day in the prison-yard,
and desired the jailer to let us have some straw. He
surlily answered, "You do not look like men that
would lie on straw."</p>

<p>After a while William Smith, a Friend, came to
me, and he being acquainted in the house, I asked
him what rooms there were in it, and what rooms
Friends had usually been put into before they were
put into the dungeon. I asked him also whether the
jailer or his wife was the master. He said that the
wife was master; and that, though she was lame, and
sat mostly in her chair, being only able to go on
crutches, yet she would beat her husband when he
came within her reach if he did not do as she would
have him.</p>

<p>I considered that probably many Friends might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
come to visit us, and that if we had a room to ourselves,
it would be better for them to speak to me,
and me to them, as there should be occasion. Wherefore
I desired William Smith to go speak with the
woman, and acquaint her that if she would let us
have a room, suffer our Friends to come out of the
dungeon, and leave it to us to give her what we
would, it might be better for her.</p>

<p>He went, and after some reasoning with her, she
consented; and we were put into a room. Then we
were told that the jailer would not suffer us to have
any drink out of the town brought into the prison,
but that what beer we drank we must take of him.
I told them I would remedy that, for we would get a
pail of water and a little wormwood once a day, and
that might serve us; so we should have none of his
beer, and the water he could not deny us.</p>

<p>Before we came, when the few Friends that were
prisoners there met together on First-days, if any of
them was moved to pray to the Lord, the jailer would
come up with his quarter-staff in his hand, and his
mastiff dog at his heels, and pluck them down by the
hair of the head, and strike them with his staff; but
when he struck Friends, the mastiff dog, instead of
falling upon them, would take the staff out of his
hand.</p>

<p>When the First-day came, I spoke to one of my
fellow-prisoners, to carry a stool and set it in the
yard, and give notice to the debtors and felons that
there would be a meeting in the yard, and they that
would hear the Word of the Lord declared might
come thither. So the debtors and prisoners gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
in the yard, and we went down, and had a very precious
meeting, the jailer not meddling.</p>

<p>Thus every First-day we had a meeting as long as
we stayed in prison; and several came in out of the
town and country. Many were convinced, and some
there received the Lord's Truth who have stood
faithful witnesses for it ever since.</p>

<p>When the sessions came we were brought before
the justices, with many more Friends, sent to prison
whilst we were there, to the number of about twenty.
The jailer put us into the place where the thieves
were put, and then some of the justices began to tender
the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to us. I
told them I never took any oath in my life; and they
knew we could not swear, because Christ and His
Apostle forbade it; therefore they but put it as a
snare to us. We told them that if they could prove
that, after Christ and the Apostle had forbidden
swearing, they did ever command Christians to
swear, then we would take these oaths; otherwise we
were resolved to obey Christ's command and the
Apostle's exhortation.</p>

<p>They said we must take the oath that we might
manifest our allegiance to the king. I told them
I had been formerly sent up a prisoner by Colonel
Hacker, from that town to London, under pretence
that I had held meetings to plot to bring in King
Charles. I also desired them to read our mittimus,
which set forth the cause of our commitment to be
that we "were to have a meeting"; and I said Lord
Beaumont could not by that act send us to jail unless
we had been taken at a meeting, and found to be such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
persons as the act speaks of; therefore we desired
that they would read the mittimus and see how
wrongfully we were imprisoned.</p>

<p>They would not take notice of the mittimus, but
called a jury and indicted us for refusing to take the
oaths of allegiance and supremacy. When the jury
was sworn and instructed, as they were going out,
one that had been an alderman of the city spoke to
them, and bade them "have a good conscience"; and
one of the jury, being a peevish man, told the justices
there was one affronted the jury; whereupon
they called him up, and tendered him the oath also,
and he took it.</p>

<p>While we were standing where the thieves used to
stand, a cut-purse had his hand in several Friends'
pockets. Friends declared it to the justices, and
showed them the man. They called him up before
them, and upon examination he could not deny it;
yet they set him at liberty.</p>

<p>It was not long before the jury returned, and
brought us in guilty; and after some words, the justices
whispered together, and bid the jailer take us
to prison again; but the Lord's power was over them,
and His everlasting Truth, which we declared boldly
amongst them. There being a great concourse of
people, most of them followed us; so that the crier
and bailiffs were fain to call the people back again
to the court.</p>

<p>We declared the Truth as we went along the
streets, till we came to the jail, the streets being full
of people.</p>

<p>When we were in our chamber again, after some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
time the jailer came to us and desired all to go forth
that were not prisoners. When they were gone he
said, "Gentlemen, it is the court's pleasure that ye
should be set at liberty, except those that are in for
tithes; and you know there are fees due to me; but
I shall leave it to you to give me what you will."</p>

<p>Thus we were all set at liberty on a sudden, and
passed every one into our services. Leonard Fell
went with me again to Swannington.</p>

<p>I had a letter from Lord Hastings, who, hearing of
my imprisonment, had written from London to the
justices of the sessions to set me at liberty. I had
not delivered this letter to the justices; whether any
knowledge of his mind received through another
hand made them discharge us so suddenly, I know
not. This letter I carried to Lord Beaumont, who
had sent us to prison. When he had broken it open
and read it, he seemed much troubled; but at last
he came a little lower, yet threatened us that if we
had any more meetings at Swannington, he would
break them up and send us to prison again.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding his threats, we went to
Swannington, and had a meeting with Friends there,
and he neither came nor sent to break it up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[After travelling through Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire
and Warwickshire, he came again to London.]</p></blockquote>

<p>I stayed not long in London, but went into Essex,
and so to Norfolk, having great meetings. At
Norwich, when I came to Captain Lawrence's, there
was a great threatening of disturbance; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
meeting was quiet. Passing thence to Sutton, and
into Cambridgeshire, I heard of Edward Burrough's
decease. Being sensible how great a grief and exercise
it would be to Friends to part with him, I wrote
the following lines for the staying and settling of
their minds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friends</span>:</p>

<p>"Be still and quiet in your own conditions, and
settled in the Seed of God, that doth not change; that
in that ye may feel dear Edward Burrough among
you in the Seed, in which and by which he begat you
to God, with whom he is; and that in the Seed ye may
all see and feel him, in which is the unity with him
in the life; and so enjoy him in the life that doth not
change, which is invisible.</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">George Fox.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_138_175" id="FNanchor_138_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_175" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>[Hereupon extensive travels follow, throughout the
eastern counties, then through the southern as far as
Land's End, and again through Wales and the English
Lake district. He finally reaches Swarthmore some
time in 1663, and finds that an offer of twenty-five
pounds has been made to any man who would take him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Out of the experiences of this long, though somewhat
uneventful trip we give only the following discussion,
which throws good light on Fox's "principle of
truth":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Next morning, some of the chief of the town<a name="FNanchor_AL_176" id="FNanchor_AL_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_176" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> desired
to speak with me, amongst whom was Colonel
Rouse. I went, and had a great deal of discourse with
them concerning the things of God. In their reasoning
they said, 'The gospel was the four books of Matthew,
Mark, Luke and John'; and they called it natural. I
told them, the gospel was the power of God, which was
preached before Matthew, Mark, Luke or John were
written; and it was preached to every creature, of
which a great part might never see nor hear of those
four books, so that every creature was to obey the
power of God; for Christ, the Spiritual Man, would
judge the world according to the gospel, that is, according
to his invisible power. When they heard this, they
could not gainsay; for the Truth came over them. I
directed them to their Teacher, the grace of God, and
showed them the sufficiency of it, which would teach
them how to live, and what to deny; and being obeyed
would bring them salvation. So to that grace I recommended
them, and left them."]</p></blockquote>

<p>I came over the sands to Swarthmore. There they
told me that Colonel Kirby had sent his lieutenant,
who had searched trunks and chests for me.</p>

<p>That night, as I was in bed, I was moved of the
Lord to go next day to Kirby Hall, which was Colonel
Kirby's house, about five miles off, to speak with him.
When I came thither I found the Flemings, and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
others of the gentry (so called) of the country,
who were come to take their leave of Colonel Kirby,
he being then about to go up to London to the Parliament.
I was taken into the parlour amongst them;
but Colonel Kirby was not then within, being gone
out a little way. They said little to me, nor I much
to them.</p>

<p>After a little while Colonel Kirby came in, and I
told him I came to visit him (understanding he was
desirous to see me) to know what he had to say to me,
and whether he had anything against me.</p>

<p>He said, before all the company, "As I am a gentleman,
I have nothing against you." "But," said
he, "Mistress Fell must not keep great meetings at
her house, for they meet contrary to the Act."</p>

<p>I told him that that Act did not take hold on us,
but on such as "met to plot and contrive, and to raise
insurrections against the King"; whereas we were no
such people: for he knew that they that met at Margaret
Fell's were his neighbours, and a peaceable people.</p>

<p>After many words had passed, he shook me by the
hand, and said again that he had nothing against me;
and others of them said I was a deserving man. So
we parted, and I returned to Swarthmore.</p>

<p>Shortly after, when Colonel Kirby was gone to
London, there was a private meeting of the justices
and deputy-lieutenants at Houlker Hall, where Justice
Preston lived, where they granted a warrant to
apprehend me. I heard over night both of their
meeting and of the warrant, and could have gone out
of their reach if I would, for I had not appointed any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
meeting at that time, and I had cleared myself of the
north, and the Lord's power was over all. But I considered
that there being a noise of a plot in the north,
if I should go away they might fall upon Friends;
but if I gave myself up to be taken, it might prevent
them, and Friends should escape the better. So I
gave myself up to be taken, and prepared for their
coming.</p>

<p>Next day an officer came with his sword and pistols
to take me. I told him I knew his errand before,
and had given myself to be taken; for if I would have
escaped their imprisonment I could have been forty
miles off before he came; but I was an innocent man,
and so it mattered not what they could do to me. He
asked me how I heard of it, seeing the order was
made privately in a parlour. I said it was no matter
for that; it was sufficient that I heard it.</p>

<p>I asked him to let me see his order, whereupon he
laid his hand on his sword, and said I must go with
him before the lieutenant to answer such questions as
they should propound to me. I told him it was but
civil and reasonable for him to let me see his order;
but he would not. Then said I, "I am ready."</p>

<p>So I went along with him, and Margaret Fell accompanied
us to Houlker Hall. When we came
thither there was one Rawlinson, a justice, and one
called Sir George Middleton, and many more that I
did not know, besides old Justice Preston, who lived
there.</p>

<p>They brought Thomas Atkinson, a Friend, of Cartmel,
as a witness against me for some words which he
had told to one Knipe, who had informed them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
which words were that I said I had written against
the plotters and had knocked them down. These
words they could not make much of, for I told them
I had heard of a plot, and had written against it.</p>

<p>Old Preston asked me whether I had an hand in
that script. I asked him what he meant. He said,
"in the Battledore?" I answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>Then he asked me whether I understood languages.
I said, "Sufficient for myself," and that I knew no
law that was transgressed by it. I told them also
that to understand outward languages was no matter
of salvation, for the many tongues began but at the
confusion of Babel; and if I did understand anything
of them, I judged and knocked them down again for
any matter of salvation that was in them.</p>

<p>Thereupon he turned away, and said, "George Fox
knocks down all the languages; come," said he, "we
will examine you of higher matters."</p>

<p>Then said George Middleton, "You deny God, and
the Church, and the faith."</p>

<p>I replied, "Nay, I own God and the true Church,
and the true faith. But what Church dost thou
own?" said I (for I understood he was a Papist).</p>

<p>Then he turned again and said, "You are a rebel
and a traitor."</p>

<p>I asked him to whom he spoke, or whom did he call
rebel. He was so full of envy that for a while he
could not speak, but at last he said, "I spoke it to
you."</p>

<p>With that I struck my hand on the table, and told
him, "I have suffered more than twenty such as
thou; more than any that is here; for I have been cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
into Derby dungeon for six months together, and
have suffered much because I would not take up arms
against this King before Worcester fight. I was sent
up a prisoner out of my own country by Colonel
Hacker to Oliver Cromwell, as a plotter to bring in
King Charles in the year 1654. I have nothing but
love and good-will to the King, and desire the eternal
good and welfare of him and all his subjects."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the like?" said Middleton.
"Nay," said I. "Ye may hear it again if ye will.
For ye talk of the King, a company of you, but where
were ye in Oliver's days, and what did ye do then for
him? But I have more love to the King for his
eternal good and welfare than any of you have."</p>

<p>Then they asked me whether I had heard of the
plot. I said, "Yes, I have heard of it."</p>

<p>They asked me how I had heard of it, and whom
I knew in it. I told them I had heard of it through
the high-sheriff of Yorkshire, who had told Dr. Hodgson
that there was a plot in the north. That was the
way I had heard of it; but I had never heard of any
such thing in the south, nor till I came into the north.
As for knowing any in the plot, I was as a child in
that, for I knew none of them.</p>

<p>Then said they, "Why would you write against it
if you did not know some that were in it?"</p>

<p>I said, "My reason was, because you are so forward
to crush the innocent and guilty together;
therefore I wrote against it to clear the Truth<a name="FNanchor_AM_177" id="FNanchor_AM_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_177" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> and to
stop all forward, foolish spirits from running into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
such things. I sent copies of it into Westmoreland,
Cumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire, and to you
here. I sent another copy of it to the King and his
council, and it is likely it may be in print by this
time."</p>

<p>One of them said, "This man hath great power!"</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, I have power to write against plotters."</p>

<p>Then said one of them, "You are against the laws
of the land."</p>

<p>I answered, "Nay, for I and my Friends direct
all people to the Spirit of God in them, to mortify
the deeds of the flesh. This brings them into welldoing,
and away from that which the magistrate's
sword is against, which eases the magistrates, who are
for the punishment of evil-doers. So people being
turned to the Spirit of God, which brings them to
mortify the deeds of the flesh; this brings them from
under the occasion of the magistrate's sword; and this
must needs be one with magistracy, and one with the
law, which was added because of transgression, and
is for the praise of them that do well. In this we
establish the law, are an ease to the magistrates, and
are not against, but stand for all good government."</p>

<p>Then George Middleton cried, "Bring the book,
and put the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to
him."</p>

<p>Now he himself being a Papist, I asked him
whether he, who was a swearer, had taken the oath of
supremacy. As for us, we could not swear at all, because
Christ and the Apostle had forbidden it.</p>

<p>Some of them would not have had the oath put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
me, but would have set me at liberty. The rest would
not agree to it, for this was their last snare, and they
had no other way to get me into prison, as all other
things had been cleared to them. This was like the
Papists' sacrament of the altar, by which they ensnared
the martyrs.<a name="FNanchor_139_178" id="FNanchor_139_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_178" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>So they tendered me the oath, which I could not
take; whereupon they were about to make my mittimus
to send me to Lancaster jail; but considering of
it, they only engaged me to appear at the sessions,
and for that time dismissed me.</p>

<p>I went back with Margaret Fell to Swarthmore,
and soon after Colonel West, who was at that time a
justice of the peace, came to see me. He told us
that he had acquainted some of the rest of the justices
that he would come and see Margaret Fell and me;
"but it may be," said he, "some of you will take
offence at it." I asked him, what he thought they
would do with me at the sessions? He said they
would tender the oath to me again.</p>

<p>Whilst I was at Swarthmore, William Kirby came
into Swarthmore meeting, and brought the constables
with him. I was sitting with Friends in the
meeting, and he said to me, "How now, Mr. Fox!
you have a fine company here." "Yes," said I, "we
meet to wait upon the Lord."</p>

<p>So he began to take the names of Friends, and
those that did not readily tell him their names he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
committed to the constables' hands, and sent some to
prison. The constables were unwilling to take them
without a warrant, whereupon he threatened to set
them by the heels; but the constable told him that
he could keep them in his presence, but after he was
gone he could not keep them without a warrant.</p>

<p>The sessions coming on, I went to Lancaster, and
appeared according to my engagement. There was
upon the bench Justice Fleming, who had bid five
pounds in Westmoreland to any man that would apprehend
me, for he was a justice both in Westmoreland
and Lancashire. There were also Justice Spencer,
Colonel West and old Justice Rawlinson, the
lawyer, who gave the charge, and was very sharp
against Truth and Friends; but the Lord's power
stopped them.</p>

<p>The session was large, the concourse of people
great, and way being made for me, I came up to the
bar, and stood with my hat on, they looking earnestly
upon me and I upon them for a pretty space.</p>

<p>Proclamation being made for all to keep silence
upon pain of imprisonment, and all being quiet, I
said twice, "Peace be among you."</p>

<p>The chairman asked if I knew where I was. I said,
"Yes, I do; but it may be," said I, "my hat offends
you. That's a low thing; that's not the honour that
I give to magistrates, for the true honour is from
above; which," said I, "I have received, and I hope
it is not the hat which ye look upon to be the
honour."</p>

<p>The chairman said they looked for the hat, too,
and asked wherein I showed my respect to magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
if I did not put off my hat. I replied, "In
coming when they called me." Then they bade one
take off my hat.</p>

<p>After this it was some time before they spoke to
me, and I felt the power of the Lord to arise. After
some pause old Justice Rawlinson, the chairman,
asked me if I knew of the plot. I told him I had
heard of it in Yorkshire by a Friend, who had it
from the high-sheriff. They asked me whether I had
declared it to the magistrates. I said, "I sent papers
abroad against plots and plotters, and also to you,
as soon as I came into the country, to take all jealousies
out of your minds concerning me and my
friends; for it is our principle to declare against such
things."</p>

<p>They asked me if I knew not of an Act against
meeting. I said I knew there was an Act that took
hold of such as met to the terrifying of the King's
subjects, were enemies to the King, and held dangerous
principles; but I hoped they did not look upon us
to be such men, for our meetings were not to terrify
the King's subjects, neither are we enemies to him or
any man.</p>

<p>Then they tendered me the oaths of allegiance and
supremacy. I told them I could not take any oath
at all, because Christ and His Apostle had forbidden
it; and they had sufficient experience of swearers,
first one way, then another; but I had never taken
any oath in my life.</p>

<p>Then Rawlinson asked me whether I held it was
unlawful to swear. This question he put on purpose
to ensnare me; for by an Act that was made those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
were liable to banishment or a great fine that should
say it was unlawful to swear. But I, seeing the
snare, avoided it, and told him that "in the time of
the law amongst the Jews, before Christ came, the
law commanded them to swear; but Christ, who doth
fulfil the law in His gospel-time, commands not to
swear at all; and the apostle James forbids swearing,
even to them that were Jews, and had the law of
God."</p>

<p>After much discourse, they called for the jailer,
and committed me to prison.</p>

<p>I had about me the paper which I had written as a
testimony against plots, which I desired they would
read, or suffer to be read, in open court; but they
would not. So, being committed for refusing to
swear, I bade them and all the people take notice that
I suffered for the doctrine of Christ, and for my
obedience to His command.</p>

<p>Afterwards I understood that the justices said
they had private instructions from Colonel Kirby to
prosecute me, notwithstanding his fair carriage and
seeming kindness to me before, when he declared before
many of them that he had nothing against me.</p>

<p>Several other Friends were committed to prison,
some for meeting to worship God, and some for
not swearing; so that the prison was very full. Many
of them being poor men, that had nothing to maintain
their families by but their labour, which now
they were taken from, the wives of several went to
the justices who had committed their husbands, and
told them that if they kept their husbands in jail for
nothing but the truth of Christ, and for good conscience'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
sake, they would bring their children to them
to be maintained.</p>

<p>A mighty power of the Lord rose in Friends, and
gave them great boldness, so that they spoke much
to the justices. Friends also that were prisoners
wrote to the justices, laying the weight of their sufferings
upon them, and showing them both their injustice
and want of compassion towards their poor
neighbours, whom they knew to be honest, conscientious,
peaceable people, that in tenderness of conscience
could not take any oath; yet they sent them to
prison for refusing to take the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>Several who were imprisoned on that account were
known to be men that had served the King in his
wars, and had hazarded their lives in the field in his
cause, and had suffered great hardships, with the loss
of much blood, for him, and had always stood faithful
to him from first to last, and had never received any
pay for their service. To be thus requited for all
their faithful services and sufferings, and that by
them that pretended to be the King's friends, was
hard, unkind, and ungrateful dealing.</p>

<p>At length the justices, being continually attended
with complaints of grievances, released some of the
Friends, but kept divers of them still in prison.</p>

<p>I was kept till the assize, and Judge Turner and
Judge Twisden coming that circuit, I was brought
before Judge Twisden, the 14th of the month called
March, the latter end of the year 1663.</p>

<p>When I was brought to the bar, I said, "Peace be
amongst you all." The Judge looked upon me, and
said, "What! do you come into the court with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
hat on!" Upon which words, the jailer taking it off,
I said, "The hat is not the honour that comes from
God."</p>

<p>Then said the Judge to me, "Will you take the
oath of allegiance, George Fox?" I said, "I never
took any oath in my life, nor any covenant or engagement."
"Well," said he, "will you swear or no?"
I answered, "I am a Christian, and Christ commands
me not to swear; so does the apostle James; and
whether I should obey God or man, do thou judge."</p>

<p>"I ask you again," said he, "whether you will
swear or no." I answered again, "I am neither
Turk, Jew, nor heathen, but a Christian, and should
show forth Christianity."</p>

<p>I asked him if he did not know that Christians in
the primitive times, under the ten persecutions, and
some also of the martyrs in Queen Mary's days, refused
swearing, because Christ and the apostle had
forbidden it. I told him also that they had had experience
enough, how many had first sworn for the
King and then against him. "But as for me," I said,
"I have never taken an oath in my life. My allegiance
doth not lie in swearing, but in truth and
faithfulness, for I honour all men, much more the
King. But Christ, who is the Great Prophet, the
King of kings, the Saviour and Judge of the whole
world, saith I must not swear. Now, must I obey
Christ or thee? For it is because of tenderness of
conscience, and in obedience to the command of
Christ, that I do not swear and we have the word
of a King for tender consciences."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>Then I asked the Judge if he did own the King.
"Yes," said he, "I do own the King."</p>

<p>"Why, then," said I, "dost thou not observe his
declaration from Breda, and his promises made since
he came into England, that no man should be called
in question for matters of religion so long as he lived
peaceably? If thou ownest the King," said I, "why
dost thou call me in question, and put me upon taking
an oath, which is a matter of religion; seeing that
neither thou nor any one else can charge me with unpeaceable
living?"</p>

<p>Upon this he was moved, and, looking angrily at
me, said, "Sirrah, will you swear?"</p>

<p>I told him I was none of his Sirrahs; I was a
Christian; and for him, an old man and a judge, to sit
there and give nicknames to prisoners did not become
either his grey hairs or his office."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I am a Christian, too."</p>

<p>"Then do Christian works," said I.</p>

<p>"Sirrah!" said he, "thou thinkest to frighten me
with thy words." Then, catching himself, and looking
aside, he said, "Hark! I am using the word sirrah
again;" and so checked himself.</p>

<p>I said, "I spoke to thee in love; for that language
did not become thee, a judge. Thou oughtest to instruct
a prisoner in the law, if he were ignorant and
out of the way."</p>

<p>"And I speak in love to thee, too," said he.</p>

<p>"But," said I, "love gives no nicknames."</p>

<p>Then he roused himself up, and said, "I will not
be afraid of thee, George Fox; thou speakest so loud
thy voice drowns mine and the court's; I must call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
for three or four criers to drown thy voice; thou hast
good lungs."</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner here," said I, "for the Lord
Jesus Christ's sake; for His sake do I suffer; for Him
do I stand this day. If my voice were five times
louder, I should lift it up and sound it for Christ's
sake. I stand this day before your judgment-seat in
obedience to Christ, who commands not to swear;
before whose judgment-seat you must all be brought
and must give an account."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Judge, "George Fox, say
whether thou wilt take the oath, yea or nay?"</p>

<p>I replied, "I say, as I said before, judge thou
whether I ought to obey God or man. If I could take
any oath at all I should take this. I do not deny
some oaths only, or on some occasions, but all oaths,
according to Christ's doctrine, who hath commanded
His followers not to swear at all. Now if thou, or
any of you, or your ministers or priests here, will
prove that ever Christ or His apostles, after they had
forbidden all swearing, commanded Christians to
swear, then I will swear."</p>

<p>I saw several priests there, but not one of them
offered to speak.</p>

<p>"Then," said the Judge, "I am a servant to the
King, and the King sent me not to dispute with you,
but to put the laws in execution; therefore tender
him the oath of allegiance."</p>

<p>"If thou love the King," said I, "why dost thou
break his word, and not keep his declarations and
speeches, wherein he promised liberty to tender consciences?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
I am a man of a tender conscience, and, in
obedience to Christ's command, I cannot swear."</p>

<p>"Then you will not swear," said the Judge; "take
him away, jailer."</p>

<p>I said, "It is for Christ's sake that I cannot swear,
and for obedience to His command I suffer; and so
the Lord forgive you all."</p>

<p>So the jailer took me away; but I felt that the
mighty power of the Lord was over them all.</p>

<p>The sixteenth day of the same month I was again
brought before Judge Twisden. He was somewhat
offended at my hat; but it being the last morning of
the assize before he was to leave town, and not many
people there, he made the less of it.</p>

<p>He asked me whether I would "traverse, stand
mute, or submit." But he spoke so fast that it was
hard to know what he said. However, I told him I
desired I might have liberty to traverse the indictment,
and try it.</p>

<p>Then said he, "Take him away; I will have nothing
to do with him; take him away."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, live in the fear of God, and do justice."</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "have I not done you justice?"</p>

<p>I replied, "That which thou hast done has been
against the command of Christ."</p>

<p>So I was taken to the jail again, and kept prisoner
till the next assizes.</p>

<p>Some time before this assize Margaret Fell was
sent prisoner to Lancaster jail by Fleming, Kirby, and
Preston, justices; and at the assize the oath was tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
to her also, and she was again committed to
prison.</p>

<p>In the Sixth month,<a name="FNanchor_140_179" id="FNanchor_140_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_179" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> the assizes were again held
at Lancaster, and the same judges, Twisden and
Turner, again came that circuit. But Judge Turner
then sat on the crown bench, and so I was
brought before him. Before I was called to the bar
I was put among the murderers and felons for about
two hours, the people, the justices and also the Judge
gazing upon me.</p>

<p>After they had tried several others, they called me
to the bar, and empanelled a jury. Then the Judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
asked the justices whether they had tendered me the
oath at the sessions. They said that they had. Then
he said, "Give them the book, that they may swear
they tendered him the oath at the sessions." They
said they had. Then he said, "Give them the book,
that they may swear they tendered him the oath according
to the indictment."</p>

<p>Some of the justices refused to be sworn; but the
Judge said he would have it done, to take away all occasion
of exception. When the jury were sworn, and
the justices had sworn that they had tendered me the
oath according to the indictment, the Judge asked me
whether I had not refused the oath at the last assizes.
I said, "I never took an oath in my life, and Christ,
the Saviour and Judge of the world, said, 'Swear not
at all.'"</p>

<p>The Judge seemed not to take notice of my answer,
but asked me whether or not I had refused to
take the oath at the last assizes.</p>

<p>I said, "The words that I then spoke to them were,
that if they could prove, either judge, justices, priest,
or teacher, that after Christ and the Apostle had forbidden
swearing, they commanded that Christians
should swear, I would swear."</p>

<p>The Judge said he was not at that time to dispute
whether it was lawful to swear, but to inquire
whether I had refused to take the oath.</p>

<p>I told him, "Those things mentioned in the oath,
as plotting against the King, and owning the Pope's,
or any other foreign power, I utterly deny."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "you say well in that, but did
you refuse to take the oath? What say you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>"What wouldst thou have me to say?" said I;
"I have told thee before what I did say."</p>

<p>Then he asked me if I would have these men to
swear that I had taken the oath. I asked him if he
would have those men to swear that I had refused the
oath, at which the court burst into laughter.</p>

<p>I was grieved to see so much lightness in a court,
where such solemn matters are handled, and thereupon
asked them, "Is this court a play-house? Where
is gravity and sobriety," said I; "this behaviour doth
not become you."</p>

<p>Then the clerk read the indictment, and I told the
Judge I had something to speak to it; for I had informed
myself of the errors that were in it. He told
me he would hear afterwards any reasons that I could
allege why he should not give judgment.</p>

<p>Then I spoke to the jury, and told them that they
could not bring me in guilty according to that indictment,
for the indictment was wrong laid, and had
many gross errors in it.</p>

<p>The Judge said that I must not speak to the jury,
but he would speak to them; and he told them I had
refused to take the oath at the last assizes; "and,"
said he, "I can tender the oath to any man now, and
præmunire him for not taking it;" and he said they
must bring me in guilty, seeing I refused to take the
oath.</p>

<p>Then said I, "What do ye do with a form? Ye
may throw away your form then." And I told the
jury it lay upon their consciences, as they would answer
it to the Lord God before His judgment-seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the judge spoke again to the jury, and I
called to him to "do me justice."</p>

<p>The jury brought me in guilty. Thereupon I told
them that both the justices and they had forsworn
themselves, and therefore they had small cause to
laugh, as they did a little before.</p>

<p>Oh, the envy, rage, and malice that appeared
against me, and the lightness! But the Lord confounded
them, and they were wonderfully stopped.
So they set me aside, and called up Margaret Fell,
who had much good service among them; and then
the court broke up near the second hour.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we were brought in again to have
sentence passed upon us. Margaret Fell desired that
sentence might be deferred until the next morning.
I desired nothing but law and justice at his hands, for
the thieves had mercy; only I requested the Judge
to send some to see my prison, which was so bad they
would put no creature they had in it; and I told him
that Colonel Kirby, who was then on the bench, had
said I should be locked up, and no flesh alive should
come to me. The Judge shook his head, and said
that when the sentence was given he would leave me
to the favor of the jailer.</p>

<p>Most of the gentry of the country were gathered
together, expecting to hear the sentence; and the
noise amongst the people was that I should be transported.
But they were all crossed at that time; for
the sentence was deferred until the next morning,
and I was taken to prison again.</p>

<p>Upon my complaining of the badness of my prison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
some of the justices, with Colonel Kirby, went up to
see it. When they came they hardly durst go in, the
floor was so bad and dangerous, and the place so
open to wind and rain. Some that came up said,
"Surely it is a Jakes-house." When Colonel Kirby
saw it, and heard what others said of it, he excused
the matter as well as he could, saying that I should
be removed ere long to some more convenient place.</p>

<p>Next day, towards the eleventh hour, we were
called again to hear the sentence; and Margaret Fell,
being called first to the bar, she had counsel to plead,
who found many errors in her indictment. Thereupon,
after the Judge had acknowledged them, she
was set by.</p>

<p>Then the Judge asked what they could say to mine.
I was not willing to let any man plead for me, but
desired to speak to it myself; and indeed, though
Margaret had some that pleaded for her, yet she
spoke as much herself as she would. But before I
came to the bar I was moved in my spirit to pray that
God would confound their wickedness and envy, set
His truth over all, and exalt His seed. The Lord
heard, and answered, and did confound them in their
proceedings against me. And, though they had most
envy against me, yet the most gross errors were
found in my indictment.</p>

<p>I having put by others from pleading for me, the
Judge asked me what I had to say why he should not
pass sentence upon me. I told him I was no lawyer;
but I had much to say, if he would but have patience
to hear. At that he laughed, and others laughed also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
and said, "Come, what have you to say? He can say
nothing." "Yes," said I, "I have much to say; have
but the patience to hear me."</p>

<p>I asked him whether the oath was to be tendered
to the King's subjects, or to the subjects of foreign
princes. He said, "To the subjects of this realm."
"Then," said I, "look into the indictment; ye may
see that ye have left out the word 'subject'; so not
having named me in the indictment as a subject, ye
cannot præmunire me for not taking an oath."</p>

<p>Then they looked over the statute and the indictment,
and saw it was as I said; and the Judge confessed
it was an error.</p>

<p>I told him I had something else to stop his judgment,
and desired him to look what day the indictment
said the oath was tendered to me at the sessions
there. They looked, and said it was the eleventh day
of January. "What day of the week was the sessions
held on?" said I. "On a Tuesday," said they.
"Then," said I, "look in your almanacs, and see
whether there was any sessions held at Lancaster on
the eleventh day of January, so called."</p>

<p>So they looked, and found that the eleventh day
was the day called Monday, and that the sessions was
on the day called Tuesday, which was the twelfth day
of that month.</p>

<p>"Look now," said I, "ye have indicted me for refusing
the oath in the quarter-sessions held at Lancaster
on the eleventh day of January last, and the
justices have sworn that they tendered me the oath
in open sessions here that day, and the jury upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
their oaths have found me guilty thereupon; and yet
ye see there was no session held in Lancaster that
day."</p>

<p>Then the Judge, to cover the matter, asked
whether the sessions did not begin on the eleventh
day. But some in the court answered, "No; the session
held but one day, and that was the twelfth."
Then the Judge said this was a great mistake and an
error.</p>

<p>Some of the justices were in a great rage at this,
stamped, and said, "Who hath done this? Somebody
hath done this on purpose;" and a great heat was
amongst them.</p>

<p>Then said I, "Are not the justices here, that have
sworn to this indictment, forsworn men in the face
of the country? But this is not all," said I. "I have
more yet to offer why sentence should not be given
against me." I asked, "In what year of the King
was the last assize here holden, which was in the
month called March last?" The Judge said it was in
the sixteenth year of the King. "But," said I, "the
indictment says it was in the fifteenth year." They
looked, and found it so. This also was acknowledged
to be another error.</p>

<p>Then they were all in a fret again, and could not
tell what to say; for the Judge had sworn the officers
of the court that the oath was tendered to me at the
assize mentioned in the indictment. "Now," said I,
"is not the court here forsworn also, who have sworn
that the oath was tendered to me at the assize holden
here in the fifteenth year of the King, when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
in his sixteenth year, and so they have sworn a year
false?"</p>

<p>The Judge bade them look whether Margaret Fell's
indictment was so or no. They looked, and found it
was not so.</p>

<p>I told the Judge I had more yet to offer to stop
sentence; and asked him whether all the oath ought
to be put into the indictment or no. "Yes," said he,
"it ought to be all put in."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "compare the indictment with the
oath, and there thou mayest see these words: viz., 'or
by any authority derived, or pretended to be derived
from him or his see,' which is a principal part of the
oath, left out of the indictment; and in another place
the words, 'heirs and successors,' are left out."</p>

<p>The Judge acknowledged these also to be great errors.</p>

<p>"But," said I, "I have something further to allege."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Judge, "I have enough; you need
say no more."</p>

<p>"If," said I, "thou hast enough, I desire nothing
but law and justice at thy hands; for I don't look for
mercy."</p>

<p>"You must have justice," said he, "and you shall
have law."</p>

<p>Then I asked, "Am I at liberty, and free from all
that ever hath been done against me in this matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Judge, "you are free from all
that hath been done against you. But then," starting
up in a rage, he said, "I can put the oath to any man
here, and I will tender you the oath again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>I told him he had had examples enough yesterday
of swearing and false swearing, both in the justices
and in the jury; for I saw before mine eyes that both
justices and jury had forsworn themselves.</p>

<p>The Judge asked me if I would take the oath. I
bade him do me justice for my false imprisonment
all this while; for what had I been imprisoned so long
for? and I told him I ought to be set at liberty.</p>

<p>"You are at liberty," said he, "but I will put the
oath to you again."</p>

<p>Then I turned me about and said, "All people,
take notice; this is a snare; for I ought to be set free
from the jailer and from this court."</p>

<p>But the Judge cried, "Give him the book;" and
the sheriff and the justices cried, "Give him the
book."</p>

<p>Then the power of darkness rose up in them like a
mountain, and a clerk lifted up a book to me. I
stood still and said, "If it be a Bible, give it me into
my hand."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Judge and justices, "give it
him into his hand." So I took it and looked into it,
and said, "I see it is a Bible; I am glad of it."</p>

<p>Now he had caused the jury to be called, and they
stood by; for, after they had brought in their former
verdict, he would not dismiss them, though they desired
it; but told them he could not dismiss them yet,
for he should have business for them, and therefore
they must attend and be ready when they were
called.</p>

<p>When he said so I felt his intent, that if I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
freed, he would come on again. So I looked him in
the face, and the witness of God started up in him,
and made him blush when he looked at me again, for
he saw that I saw him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, hardening himself, he caused the
oath to be read to me, the jury standing by; and
when it was read, he asked me whether I would take
the oath or not.</p>

<p>Then said I, "Ye have given me a book here to
kiss and to swear on, and this book which ye have
given me to kiss says, 'Kiss the Son'; and the Son
says in this book, 'Swear not at all'; and so says also
the apostle James. Now, I say as the book says, and
yet ye imprison me; why do ye not imprison the book
for saying so? How comes it that the book (which
bids me not swear) is at liberty amongst you, and yet
ye imprison me for doing as the book bids me?"</p>

<p>As I was speaking this to them, and held up the
Bible open in my hand, to show them the place in
the book where Christ forbids swearing, they plucked
the book out of my hand again; and the Judge said,
"Nay, but we will imprison George Fox." Yet this
got abroad over all the country as a by-word, that
"they gave me a book to swear on that commanded
me 'not to swear at all'; and that the Bible was at
liberty, and I in prison for doing as the Bible said."</p>

<p>Now, when the Judge still urged me to swear, I
told him I had never taken oath, covenant, or engagement
in my life, but my yea or nay was more
binding to me than an oath was to many others; for
had they not had experience how little men regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
an oath; and how they had sworn one way and then
another; and how the justices and court had forsworn
themselves now? I told him I was a man of a tender
conscience, and if they had any sense of a tender
conscience they would consider that it was in obedience
to Christ's command that I could not swear.
"But," said I, "if any of you can convince me that
after Christ and the apostle had commanded not to
swear, they altered that command and commanded
Christians to swear, then ye shall see I will swear."</p>

<p>There being many priests by, I said, "If ye cannot
do it, let your priests stand up and do it." But not
one of the priests made any answer.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Judge, "all the world cannot convince
you."</p>

<p>"No," said I, "how is it likely the world should
convince me; for 'the whole world lies in wickedness';
but bring out your spiritual men, as ye call
them, to convince me."</p>

<p>Then both the sheriff and the Judge said, "The
angel swore in the Revelations." I replied, "When
God bringeth His first-begotten Son into the world,
He saith, 'Let all the angels of God worship Him';
and He saith, 'Swear not at all.'"</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Judge, "I will not dispute."</p>

<p>Then I spoke to the jury, telling them it was for
Christ's sake that I could not swear, and therefore I
warned them not to act contrary to the witness of
God in their consciences, for before His judgment-seat
they must all be brought. And I told them that
as for plots and persecution for religion and Popery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
"I do deny them in my heart; for I am a Christian,
and shall show forth Christianity amongst you this
day. It is for Christ's doctrine I stand." More
words I had both with the Judge and jury before the
jailer took me away.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I was brought up again, and put
among the thieves some time, where I stood with my
hat on till the jailer took it off. Then the jury having
found this new indictment against me for not taking
the oath, I was called to the bar; and the Judge
asked me what I would say for myself. I bade them
read the indictment, for I would not answer to that
which I did not hear. The clerk read it, and as he
read the Judge said "Take heed it be not false
again"; but he read it in such a manner that I could
hardly understand what he read.</p>

<p>When he had done the Judge asked me what I said
to the indictment. I told him that hearing but once
so large a writing read, and at such a distance that
I could not distinctly hear all the parts of it, I could
not well tell what to say to it; but if he would let me
have a copy, and give me time to consider it, I would
answer it.</p>

<p>This put them to a little stand; but after a
while the Judge asked me, "What time would you
have?"</p>

<p>I said, "Until the next assize."</p>

<p>"But," said he, "what plea will you now make?
Are you guilty or not guilty?"</p>

<p>I said, "I am not guilty at all of obstinately and
wilfully refusing to swear; and as for those things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
mentioned in the oath, as jesuitical plots and foreign
powers, I utterly deny them in my heart; and if I
could take any oath, I should take that; but I never
took any oath in my life."</p>

<p>The Judge said, "You speak well; but the King is
sworn, the Parliament is sworn, I am sworn, the justices
are sworn, and the law is preserved by oaths."</p>

<p>I told him that they had had sufficient experience
of men's swearing, and he had seen how the justices
and jury had sworn falsely the other day; and if he
had read in the "Book of Martyrs" how many of
the martyrs had refused to swear, both within the
time of the ten persecutions and in Bishop Bonner's
days, he might see that to deny swearing in obedience
to Christ's command was no new thing.</p>

<p>He said he wished the laws were otherwise.</p>

<p>I said, "Our Yea is yea, and our Nay is nay; and
if we transgress our yea and our nay, let us suffer as
they do, or should do, that swear falsely." This, I
told him, we had offered to the King; and the King
said it was reasonable.</p>

<p>After some further discourse they committed me
to prison again, there to lie until the next assize; and
Colonel Kirby gave order to the jailer to keep me
close, "and suffer no flesh alive to come at me," for
I was not fit, he said, "to be discoursed with by men."
I was put into a tower where the smoke of the other
prisoners came up so thick it stood as dew upon the
walls, and sometimes it was so thick that I could
hardly see the candle when it burned; and I being
locked under three locks, the under-jailer, when the
smoke was great, would hardly be persuaded to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
up to unlock one of the uppermost doors for fear of
the smoke, so that I was almost smothered.</p>

<p>Besides, it rained in upon my bed, and many times,
when I went to stop out the rain in the cold winter-season,
my shirt was as wet as muck with the rain
that came in upon me while I was labouring to stop
it out. And the place being high and open to the
wind, sometimes as fast as I stopped it the wind blew
it out again.</p>

<p>In this manner I lay all that long, cold winter till
the next assize, in which time I was so starved, and
so frozen with cold and wet with the rain that my
body was greatly swelled and my limbs much benumbed.</p>

<p>The assize began the sixteenth of the month called
March, 1664-5. The same Judges, Twisden and
Turner, coming that circuit again, Judge Twisden sat
this time on the crown-bench, and before him I was
brought.</p>

<p>I had informed myself of the errors in this indictment
also; for, though at the assize before Judge
Turner said to the officers in court, "Pray, see that
all the oath be in the indictment, and that the word
'subject' be in, and that the day of the month and
year of the King be put in right; for it is a shame
that so many errors should be seen and found in the
face of the country;" yet many errors, and those
great ones, were in this indictment, as well as in
the former. Surely the hand of the Lord was in it,
to confound their mischievous work against me, and
to blind them therein; insomuch that, although, after
the indictment was drawn at the former assize, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
Judge examined it himself, and tried it with the
clerks, yet the word "subject" was left out of this
indictment also, the day of the month was put in
wrong, and several material words of the oath were
left out; yet they went on confidently against me,
thinking all was safe and well.</p>

<p>When I was brought to the bar, and the jury
called over to be sworn, the clerk asked me, first,
whether I had any objection to make to any of the
jury. I told him I knew none of them. Then, having
sworn the jury, they swore three of the officers
of the court to prove that the oath was tendered to
me at the last assizes, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the Judge, "it was not done
in a corner." Then he asked me what I had to say to
it; or whether I had taken the oath at the last assize.</p>

<p>I told him what I had formerly said to them, as it
now came to my remembrance.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Judge said, "I will not dispute
with you but in point of law."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "I have something to speak to
the jury concerning the indictment."</p>

<p>He told me I must not speak to the jury; but if I
had anything to say, I must speak to him.</p>

<p>I asked him whether the oath was to be tendered
to the King's subjects only, or to the subjects of foreign
princes.</p>

<p>He replied, "To the subjects of this realm."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "look in the indictment, and thou
mayest see the word 'subject' is left out of this indictment
also. Therefore, seeing the oath is not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
be tendered to any but the subjects of this realm, and
ye have not put me in as a subject, the court is to
take no notice of this indictment."</p>

<p>I had no sooner spoken thus than the Judge cried,
"Take him away, jailer, take him away." So I was
presently hurried away.</p>

<p>The jailer and people expected that I should be
called for again; but I was never brought to the
court any more, though I had many other great errors
to assign in the indictment.</p>

<p>After I was gone, the Judge asked the jury if they
were agreed. They said, "Yes," and found for the
King against me, as I was told. But I was never
called to hear sentence given, nor was any given
against me that I could hear of.</p>

<p>I understood that when they had looked more narrowly
into the indictment they saw it was not good;
and the Judge having sworn the officers of the court
that the oath was tendered me at the assize before,
such a day, as was set forth in the indictment, and
that being the wrong day, I should have proved the
officers of the court forsworn men again, had the
Judge suffered me to plead to the indictment, which
was thought to be the reason he hurried me away so
soon.</p>

<p>The Judge had passed sentence of præmunire
upon Margaret Fell before I was brought in; and it
seems that when I was hurried away they recorded
me as a præmunired person,<a name="FNanchor_141_180" id="FNanchor_141_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_180" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> though I was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
brought to hear the sentence, or knew of it, which
was very illegal. For they should not only have had
me present to hear the sentence given, but should
also have asked me first what I could say why sentence
should not be given against me. But they
knew I had so much to say that they could not give
sentence if they heard it.</p>

<p>While I was prisoner in Lancaster Castle there
was a great noise and talk of the Turk's overspreading
Christendom, and great fears entered many. But
one day, as I was walking in my prison chamber, I
saw the Lord's power turn against him, and that he
was turning back again. And I declared to some
what the Lord had let me see, when there were such
fears of his overrunning Christendom; and within
a month after, the news came that they had given
him a defeat.</p>

<p>Another time, as I was walking in my chamber,
with my eye to the Lord, I saw the angel of the Lord
with a glittering drawn sword stretched southward,
as though the court had been all on fire. Not long
after the wars broke out with Holland, the sickness
broke forth, and afterwards the fire of London; so
the Lord's sword was drawn indeed.</p>

<p>By reason of my long and close imprisonment in
so bad a place I was become very weak in body; but
the Lord's power was over all, supported me through
all, and enabled me to do service for Him, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
His truth and people, as the place would admit. For,
while I was in Lancaster prison, I answered several
books, as the Mass, the Common-Prayer, the Directory
and the Church-Faith,<a name="FNanchor_142_181" id="FNanchor_142_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_181" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> which are the four chief
religions that are got up since the apostles' days.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish">A Year in Scarborough Castle.</p>

<h3>1665-1666.</h3>


<p>After the assize, Colonel Kirby and other justices
were very uneasy with my being at Lancaster; for I
had galled them sore at my trials there, and they laboured
much to get me removed thence to some remote
place. Colonel Kirby sometimes threatened
that I should be sent beyond sea.</p>

<p>About six weeks after the assizes they got an order
from the King and council to remove me from
Lancaster; and with it they brought a letter from the
Earl of Anglesey, wherein it was written that if those
things with which I was charged were found true
against me, I deserved no clemency nor mercy; yet
the greatest matter they had against me was because
I could not disobey the command of Christ, and
swear.</p>

<p>When they had prepared for my removal, the under-sheriff
and the head-sheriff's man, with some bailiffs,
fetched me out of the castle, when I was so weak
with lying in that cold, wet, and smoky prison, that
I could hardly go or stand. They led me into the
jailer's house, where were William Kirby and several
others, and they called for wine to give me. I told
them I would have none of their wine. Then they
cried, "Bring out the horses."</p>

<p>I desired them first to show me their order, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
copy of it, if they intended to remove me; but they
would show me none but their swords. I told them
there was no sentence passed upon me, nor was I
præmunired, that I knew of; and therefore I was not
made the King's prisoner, but was the sheriff's; for
they and all the country knew that I was not fully
heard at the last assize, nor suffered to show the errors
in the indictment, which were sufficient to quash
it, though they had kept me from one assize to another
to the end they might try me. But they all
knew there was no sentence of præmunire passed
upon me; therefore I, not being the King's prisoner,
but the sheriff's, did desire to see their order.</p>

<p>Instead of showing me their order, they haled me
out, and lifted me upon one of the sheriff's horses.</p>

<p>When I was on horseback in the street the townspeople
being gathered to gaze upon me, I told the
officers I had received neither Christianity, civility,
nor humanity from them.</p>

<p>They hurried me away about fourteen miles to
Bentham, though I was so weak that I was hardly
able to sit on horseback, and my clothes smelt so of
smoke they were loathsome to myself. The wicked
jailer, one Hunter, a young fellow, would come behind
and give the horse a lash with his whip, and
make him skip and leap; so that I, being weak, had
much ado to sit on him; then he would come and look
me in the face and say, "How do you, Mr. Fox?" I
told him it was not civil in him to do so. The Lord
cut him off soon after.</p>

<p>When we were come to Bentham, in Yorkshire,
there met us many troopers and a marshal; and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
of the gentry of the country were come in, and
abundance of people to take a view of me. I being
very weak and weary, desired them to let me lie down
on a bed, which the soldiers permitted; for those that
brought me thither gave their order to the marshal,
and he set a guard of his soldiers upon me.</p>

<p>When they had stayed awhile they pressed horses,
raised the bailiff of the hundred, the constables, and
others, and bore me to Giggleswick that night; but
exceeding weak I was. There, with their clog shoes,
they raised the constables, who sat drinking all the
night in the room by me, so that I could not get much
rest.</p>

<p>The next day we came to a market-town, where
several Friends came to see me. Robert Widders and
divers Friends came to me upon the road.</p>

<p>The next night I asked the soldiers whither they
intended to carry me, and whither I was to be sent.
Some of them said, "Beyond sea"; others said,
"To Tynemouth Castle." A great fear there was
amongst them lest some one should rescue me out
of their hands; but that fear was needless.</p>

<p>Next night we came to York, where the marshal
put me into a great chamber, where most part of two
troops came to see me. One of these troopers, an envious
man, hearing that I was præmunired, asked me
what estate I had, and whether it was copyhold or
free land. I took no notice of his question, but was
moved to declare the Word of life to the soldiers,
and many of them were very loving.</p>

<p>At night the Lord Frecheville (so called), who
commanded these horse, came to me, and was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
civil and loving. I gave him an account of my imprisonment,
and declared many things to him relating
to Truth.</p>

<p>They kept me at York two days, and then the marshal
and four or five soldiers were sent to convey me
to Scarborough Castle. These were very civil men,
and they carried themselves civilly and lovingly to
me. On the way we baited at Malton, and they permitted
Friends to come and visit me.</p>

<p>When we were come to Scarborough, they took me
to an inn, and gave notice to the governor, who sent
six soldiers to be my guard that night. Next day they
conducted me into the castle, put me into a room,
and set a sentry on me. As I was very weak, and
subject to fainting, they sometimes let me go out into
the air with the sentry.</p>

<p>They soon removed me out of this room, and put
me into an open one, where the rain came in, and
which was exceedingly thick with smoke, which was
very offensive to me.<a name="FNanchor_143_182" id="FNanchor_143_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_182" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>One day the Governor, Sir John Crossland, came
to see me, and brought with him Sir Francis Cobb. I
desired the Governor to go into my room, and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
what a place I had. I had got a little fire made in
it, and it was so filled with smoke that when they
were in they could hardly find their way out again;
and he being a Papist, I told him that this was his
Purgatory which they had put me into. I was forced
to lay out about fifty shillings to stop out the rain,
and keep the room from smoking so much.</p>

<p>When I had been at that charge, and made it tolerable,
they removed me into a worse room, where I
had neither chimney nor fire-hearth. This being
towards the sea-side and lying much open, the wind
drove in the rain forcibly so that the water came
over my bed, and ran so about the room that I was
fain to skim it up with a platter. When my clothes
were wet, I had no fire to dry them; so that my body
was benumbed with cold, and my fingers swelled so
that one was grown as big as two.</p>

<p>Though I was at some charge in this room also, I
could not keep out the wind and rain. Besides, they
would suffer few Friends to come to me, and many
times not any; no, not so much as to bring me a little
food; but I was forced for the first quarter to hire
one of another society to bring me necessaries.
Sometimes the soldiers would take it from her, and
she would scuffle with them for it.</p>

<p>Afterwards I hired a soldier to fetch me water and
bread, and something to make a fire of, when I was in
a room where a fire could be made. Commonly a
threepenny loaf served me three weeks, and sometimes
longer, and most of my drink was water with
wormwood steeped or bruised in it.</p>

<p>One time the weather was very sharp, and I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
taken great cold, I got a little elecampane beer. I
heard one of the soldiers say to the other that they
would play me a trick: they would send me up to the
deputy-governor, and in the meantime drink my
strong beer; and so they did. When I came back one
of the soldiers came to me in a jeer, and asked me for
some strong beer. I told him they had played their
pretty trick; and so I took no further notice of it.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as they kept me so very strait, not
giving liberty for Friends to come to me, I spoke to
the keepers of the Castle to this effect: "I did not
know till I was removed from Lancaster Castle, and
brought prisoner to this Castle of Scarborough, that I
was convicted of a præmunire; for the Judge did not
give sentence upon me at the assizes in open court.
But seeing I am now a prisoner here, if I may not
have my liberty, let my friends and acquaintances
have their liberty to come and visit me, as Paul's
friends had among the Romans, who were not Christians,
but heathen. For Paul's friends had their
liberty; all that would, might come to him, and he
had his liberty to preach to them in his hired house.
But I cannot have liberty to go into the town, nor
for my friends to come to me here. So you that go
under the name of Christians, are worse in this
respect than those heathen were."</p>

<p>But though they would not let Friends come to
me, they would often bring others, either to gaze
upon me, or to contend with me. One time a great
company of Papists came to discourse with me. They
affirmed that the Pope was infallible, and had stood
infallible ever since Peter's time. But I showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
them the contrary by history; for one of the bishops
of Rome (Marcellinus by name), denied the faith and
sacrificed to idols; therefore he was not infallible. I
told them that if they were in the infallible Spirit
they need not have jails, swords, and staves, racks and
tortures, fires and faggots, whips and gallows, to hold
up their religion, and to destroy men's lives about it;
for if they were in the infallible Spirit they would
preserve men's lives, and use none but spiritual
weapons about religion.</p>

<p>Another Papist who came to discourse with me
said, "All the patriarchs were in hell from the creation
till Christ came. When Christ suffered He
went into hell, and the devil said to Him, What comest
thou hither for? to break open our strongholds?
And Christ said, To fetch them all out. So Christ
was three days and three nights in hell to bring them
out."</p>

<p>I told him that that was false; for Christ said to
the thief, "This day thou shalt be with me in paradise";
and Enoch and Elijah were translated into
heaven; and Abraham was in heaven, for the Scripture
saith that Lazarus was in his bosom; and Moses
and Elias were with Christ upon the Mount, before
He suffered.</p>

<p>These instances stopped the Papist's mouth, and
put him to a stand.</p>

<p>Another time came Dr. Witty, who was esteemed
a great doctor in physic, with Lord Falconbridge, the
governor of Tinmouth Castle, and several knights.</p>

<p>I being called to them, Witty undertook to discourse
with me, and asked me what I was in prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
for. I told him, "Because I would not disobey the
command of Christ, and swear." He said I ought to
swear my allegiance to the King.</p>

<p>He being a great Presbyterian, I asked him
whether he had not sworn against the King and
House of Lords, and taken the Scotch covenant?
And had he not since sworn to the King? What,
then, was his swearing good for? But my allegiance,
I told him, did not consist in swearing, but in truth
and faithfulness.</p>

<p>After some further discourse I was taken away to
my prison again; and afterwards Dr. Witty boasted
in the town amongst his patients that he had conquered
me. When I heard of it, I told the Governor
it was a small boast in him to say he had conquered
a bondman. I desired to bid him come to me
again when he came to the Castle.</p>

<p>He came again awhile after, with about sixteen or
seventeen great persons, and then he ran himself
worse on ground than before. For he affirmed before
them all that Christ had not enlightened every man
that cometh into the world; and that the grace of
God, that bringeth salvation, had not appeared unto
all men, and that Christ had not died for all men.</p>

<p>I asked him what sort of men those were whom
Christ had not enlightened? and whom His grace had
not appeared to? and whom He had not died for?</p>

<p>He said, "Christ did not die for adulterers, and
idolaters, and wicked men."</p>

<p>I asked him whether adulterers and wicked men
were not sinners.</p>

<p>He said, "Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did not Christ die for sinners?" said I. "Did
He not come to call sinners to repentance?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he.</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "thou hast stopped thy own
mouth."</p>

<p>So I proved that the grace of God had appeared
unto all men, though some turned from it into wantonness,
and walked despitefully against it; and that
Christ had enlightened all men, though some hated
the light.</p>

<p>Several of the people confessed it was true; but he
went away in a great rage, and came no more to me.</p>

<p>Another time the Governor brought a priest; but
his mouth was soon stopped.</p>

<p>Not long after he brought two or three Parliament-men,
who asked me whether I did own ministers
and bishops.</p>

<p>I told them, "Yes, such as Christ sent; such as
had freely received and would freely give; such as
were qualified, and were in the same power and
Spirit the apostles were in. But such bishops and
teachers as yours, that will go no farther than a great
benefice, I do not own; for they are not like the apostles.
Christ saith to his ministers, 'Go ye into all
nations, and preach the gospel'; but ye Parliament-men,
who keep your priests and bishops in such great
fat benefices, have spoiled them all. For do ye think
they will go into all nations to preach; or any farther
than a great fat benefice? Judge yourselves whether
they will or not."</p>

<p>There came another time the widow of old Lord
Fairfax, and with her a great company, one of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
was a priest. I was moved to declare the truth to
them, and the priest asked me why we said Thou and
Thee to people, for he counted us but fools and idiots
for speaking so.</p>

<p>I asked him whether they that translated the
Scriptures and that made the grammar and accidence,
were fools and idiots, seeing they translated
the Scriptures so, and made the grammar so, Thou
to one, and You to more than one, and left it so to us.
If they were fools and idiots, why had not he, and
such as he, that looked upon themselves as wise men,
and that could not bear Thou and Thee to a singular,
altered the grammar, accidence, and Bible, and put
the plural instead of the singular. But if they were
wise men that had so translated the Bible, and had
made the grammar and accidence so, I wished him to
consider whether they were not fools and idiots
themselves, that did not speak as their grammars and
Bibles taught them; but were offended with us, and
called us fools and idiots for speaking so.</p>

<p>Thus the priest's mouth was stopped, and many of
the company acknowledged the Truth, and were
pretty loving and tender. Some of them would have
given me money, but I would not receive it.</p>

<p>After this came Dr. Cradock, with three priests
more, and the Governor and his lady (so called), and
another that was called a lady, and a great company
with them.</p>

<p>Dr. Cradock asked me what I was in prison for. I
told him, "For obeying the command of Christ and
the apostle, in not swearing." But if he, I said, being
both a doctor and a justice of peace, could convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
me that after Christ and the Apostle had forbidden
swearing, they commanded Christians to swear, then
I would swear. "Here is the Bible," I told him,
"thou mayest, if thou canst, show me any such command."</p>

<p>He said, "It is written, 'Ye shall swear in truth
and righteousness.'"</p>

<p>"Ay," said I, "it was so written in Jeremiah's
time; but that was many ages before Christ commanded
not to swear at all; but where is it written
so, since Christ forbade all swearing? I could bring
as many instances out of the Old Testament for
swearing as thou, and it may be more; but of what
force are they to prove swearing lawful in the New
Testament, since Christ and the Apostle forbade it?
Besides," said I, "in that text where it is written, Ye
shall swear, what 'ye' was this? Was it 'Ye Gentiles,'
or 'Ye Jews'?"</p>

<p>To this he would not answer. But one of the
priests that were with him answered, "It was to the
Jews that this was spoken." Then Dr. Cradock confessed
it was so.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, "but where did God ever
give a command to the Gentiles to swear? For thou
knowest that we are Gentiles by nature."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said he, "in the gospel times everything
was to be established out of the mouths of two
or three witnesses; but there was to be no swearing
then."</p>

<p>"Why, then," said I, "dost thou force oaths upon
Christians, contrary to thy own knowledge, in the
gospel-times? And why dost thou excommunicate my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
friends?" for he had excommunicated abundance
both in Yorkshire and Lancashire.</p>

<p>He said, "For not coming to church." "Why,"
said I, "ye left us above twenty years ago, when we
were but young lads and lasses, to the Presbyterians,
Independents, and Baptists, many of whom made
spoil of our goods, and persecuted us because we
would not follow them. We, being but young, knew
little then of your principles. If ye had intended to
keep your principles alive, that we might have known
them, ye should either not have fled from us as ye
did, or ye should have sent us your epistles, collects,
homilies, and evening songs; for Paul wrote epistles
to the saints, though he was in prison. But they and
we might have turned Turks or Jews for any collects,
homilies, or epistles we had from you all this
while. And now thou hast excommunicated us, both
young and old, and so have others of you done; that
is, ye have put us out of your church before ye have
got us into it, and before ye have brought us to
know your principles. Is not this madness in you, to
put us out before we were brought in? Indeed, if
ye had brought us into your church, and when we
had been in, if we had done some bad thing, that had
been something like a ground for excommunication
or putting out again. But," said I, "What dost thou
call the Church?"</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "that which you call the steeple-house."</p>

<p>Then I asked him whether Christ shed His blood
for the steeple-house, and purchased and sanctified
the steeple-house with His blood. And seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
Church is Christ's bride and wife, and that He is the
Head of the Church, dost thou think the steeple-house
is Christ's wife and bride, and that He is the
head of that old house, or of His people?"</p>

<p>"No," said he, "Christ is the head of His people,
and they are the Church."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "You have given the title Church
to an old house, which belongs to the people; and you
have taught them to believe so."</p>

<p>I asked him also why he persecuted Friends for
not paying tithes; whether God ever commanded the
Gentiles to pay tithes; whether Christ had not ended
tithes when He ended the Levitical priesthood that
took tithes; whether Christ, when He sent His disciples
to preach, had not commanded them to preach
freely as He had given them freely; and whether all
the ministers of Christ are not bound to observe this
command of Christ.</p>

<p>He said he would not dispute that.</p>

<p>Neither did I find he was willing to stay on that
subject; for he presently turned to another matter,
and said, "You marry, but I know not how."</p>

<p>I replied, "It may be so; but why dost thou not
come and see?"</p>

<p>Then he threatened that he would use his power
against us, as he had done. I bade him take heed;
for he was an old man. I asked him also where he
read, from Genesis to Revelation, that ever any
priest did marry any. I wished him to show me
some instance thereof, if he would have us come to
them to be married; "for," said I, "thou hast excommunicated
one of my friends two years after he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
was dead, about his marriage. And why dost thou
not excommunicate Isaac, and Jacob, and Boaz, and
Ruth? for we do not read that they were ever married
by the priests; but they took one another in the
assemblies of the righteous, in the presence of God
and His people; and so do we. So that we have all
the holy men and women that the Scripture speaks
of in this practice, on our side."</p>

<p>Much discourse we had, but when he found he
could get no advantage over me, he went away with
his company.</p>

<p>With such people I was much exercised while I
was there; for most that came to the Castle would
desire to speak with me, and great disputes I had
with them. But as to Friends, I was as a man buried
alive; for though many came far to see me, yet few
were suffered to come to me; and when any Friend
came into the Castle about business, if he looked
towards me they would rage at him.</p>

<p>At last the Governor came under some trouble
himself; for he having sent a privateer to sea, they
took some ships that were not enemies' ships, but
their friends'; whereupon he was brought into
trouble; after which he grew somewhat more
friendly to me. For before I had a marshal set over
me, on purpose to get money out of me; but I was
not free to give him a farthing; and when they found
they could get nothing off me, he was taken away
again.</p>

<p>The officers often threatened that I should be
hanged over the wall. Nay, the deputy-governor
told me once that the King, knowing I had great interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
in the people, had sent me thither, that if there
should be any stirring in the nation, they should
hang me over the wall to keep the people down.</p>

<p>There being, a while after, a marriage at a Baptist's
house, upon which occasion a great many of
them were met together, they talked much then of
hanging me. But I told them that if that was what
they desired, and it was permitted them, I was ready,
for I never feared death nor sufferings in my life; but
I was known to be an innocent, peaceable man, free
from all stirrings and plottings, and one that sought
the good of all men.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the Governor growing kinder, I spoke
to him when he was going to London to the Parliament,
and desired him to speak to Esquire Marsh, Sir
Francis Cobb, and some others; and let them know
how long I had lain in prison, and for what; and he
did so. When he came down again, he told me that
Esquire Marsh said he would go a hundred miles
barefoot for my liberty, he knew me so well; and several
others, he said, spoke well of me. From which
time the Governor was very loving to me.</p>

<p>There were, amongst the prisoners, two very bad
men, that often sat drinking with the officers and
soldiers; and because I would not sit and drink with
them too, it made them the worse against me. One
time when these two prisoners were drunk, one of
them (whose name was William Wilkinson, a Presbyterian,
who had been a captain), came to me and challenged
me to fight with him.</p>

<p>Seeing what condition he was in, I got out of his
way; and next morning, when he was more sober,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
showed him how unmanly it was in him to challenge
a man to fight, whose principles, he knew, it was not
to strike, but if he was stricken on one ear to turn
the other. I told him, if he had a mind to fight, he
should have challenged some soldiers that could have
answered him in his own way.</p>

<p>But, however, seeing he had challenged me, I was
now come to answer him with my hands in my
pockets; and (reaching my head towards him),
"Here," said I, "here is my hair, here are my
cheeks, here is my back."</p>

<p>With this he skipped away from me and went into
another room; at which the soldiers fell a-laughing;
and one of the officers said, "You are a happy man
that can bear such things." Thus he was conquered
without a blow. After awhile he took the oath, gave
bond, got out of prison; and not long after the Lord
cut him off.<a name="FNanchor_144_183" id="FNanchor_144_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_183" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>There were great imprisonments in this and the
former years, while I was prisoner at Lancaster and
Scarborough. At London many Friends were
crowded into Newgate, and other prisons, where the
sickness was,<a name="FNanchor_145_184" id="FNanchor_145_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_184" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and many died in prison. Many also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
were banished, and several sent on ship-board by the
King's order.</p>

<p>Some masters of ships would not carry them, but
set them on shore again; yet some were sent to Barbadoes,
Jamaica, and Nevis, and the Lord blessed
them there. One master of a ship was very wicked
and cruel to Friends that were put on board his ship;
for he kept them down under decks, though the sickness
was amongst them; so that many died of it. But
the Lord visited him for his wickedness; for he lost
most of his seamen by the plague, and lay several
months crossed with contrary winds, though other
ships went on and made their voyages.</p>

<p>At last he came before Plymouth, where the Governor
and magistrates would not suffer him nor any
of his men to come ashore, though he wanted necessaries
for his voyage; but Thomas Lower, Arthur
Cotton, John Light, and other Friends, went to the
ship's side, and carried necessaries for the Friends
that were prisoners on board.</p>

<p>The master, being thus crossed and vexed, cursed
them that put him upon this freight, and said he
hoped he should not go far before he was taken. And
the vessel was but a little while gone out of sight of
Plymouth before she was taken by a Dutch man-of-war,
and carried into Holland.</p>

<p>When they came into Holland, the States sent the
banished Friends back to England, with a letter of
passport, and a certificate that they had not made an
escape, but were sent back by them.</p>

<p>In time the Lord's power wrought over this storm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
and many of our persecutors were confounded and
put to shame.</p>

<p>After I had lain prisoner above a year in Scarborough
Castle, I sent a letter to the King, in which
I gave him an account of my imprisonment, and the
bad usage I had received in prison; and also that I was
informed no man could deliver me but him. After
this, John Whitehead being at London, and having
acquaintance also with Esquire Marsh, he went to
visit him, and spoke to him about me; and he undertook,
if John Whitehead would get the state of my
case drawn up, to deliver it to the master of requests,
Sir John Birkenhead, who would endeavor to get a
release for me.</p>

<p>So John Whitehead and Ellis Hookes drew up a
relation of my imprisonment and sufferings, and carried
it to Marsh; and he went with it to the master of
requests, who procured an order from the King for
my release. The substance of the order was that
"the King, being certainly informed that I was a
man principled against plotting and fighting, and had
been ready at all times to discover plots, rather than
to make any, etc., therefore his royal pleasure was
that I should be discharged from my imprisonment,"
etc.</p>

<p>As soon as this order was obtained, John Whitehead
came to Scarborough with it, and delivered it
to the Governor; who, upon receipt thereof, gathered
the officers together, and, without requiring bond or
sureties for my peaceable living, being satisfied that
I was a man of a peaceable life, he discharged me
freely, and gave me the following passport:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Permit the bearer hereof, George Fox, late a
prisoner here, and now discharged by His Majesty's
order, quietly to pass about his lawful occasions,
without any molestation. Given under my hand at
Scarborough Castle, this first day of September,
1666.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Jordan Croslands</span>,<br />
"Governor of Scarborough Castle."
</p></blockquote>

<p>After I was released, I would have made the
Governor a present for the civility and kindness he
had of late shown me; but he would not receive anything;
saying that whatever good he could do for me
and my friends he would do it, and never do them
any hurt. And afterwards, if at any time the mayor
of the town sent to him for soldiers to break up
Friends' meetings, if he sent any down he would privately
give them a charge not to meddle. He continued
loving to his dying day.</p>

<p>The officers also and the soldiers were mightily
changed, and became very respectful to me, and
when they had occasion to speak of me they would
say, "He is as stiff as a tree, and as pure as a bell;
for we could never bow him."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Here is an interesting entry in the Journal in the
year 1669: "I then visited friends at Whitby and
Scarborough. When I was at Scarborough, the governor,
hearing I was come, sent to invite me to his
house, saying, 'Surely, you would not be so unkind as
not to come and see me and my wife.' After the meeting
I went to visit him, and he received me very courteously
and lovingly."]</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>
<p>The very next day after my release, the fire broke
out in London, and the report of it came quickly
down into the country. Then I saw the Lord God
was true and just in His Word, which he had shown
me before in Lancaster jail, when I saw the angel
of the Lord with a glittering sword drawn southward,
as before expressed.</p>

<p>The people of London were forewarned of this
fire; yet few laid to heart, or believed it; but rather
grew more wicked, and higher in pride. For a Friend
was moved to come out of Huntingdonshire a little
before the fire, to scatter his money, and turn his
horse loose on the streets, to untie the knees of his
trousers, let his stockings fall down, and to unbutton
his doublet, and tell the people that so should
they run up and down, scattering their money and
their goods, half undressed, like mad people, as he
was sign to them;<a name="FNanchor_146_185" id="FNanchor_146_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_185" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and so they did, when the city
was burning.</p>

<p>Thus hath the Lord exercised His prophets and
servants by His power, shown them signs of His
judgments, and sent them to forewarn the people;
but, instead of repenting, they have beaten and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
cruelly entreated some, and some they have imprisoned,
both in the former power's days<a name="FNanchor_AN_186" id="FNanchor_AN_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_186" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> and since.</p>

<p>But the Lord is just, and happy are they that obey
His word.</p>

<p>Some have been moved to go naked in their streets,
in the other power's days and since, as signs of their
nakedness; and have declared amongst them that
God would strip them of their hypocritical professions,
and make them as bare and naked as they were.
But instead of considering it, they have many times
whipped, or otherwise abused them, and sometimes
imprisoned them.</p>

<p>Others have been moved to go in sackcloth, and to
denounce the woes and vengeance of God against the
pride and haughtiness of the people; but few regarded
it. And in the other power's days, the
wicked, envious, and professing priests, put up several
petitions both to Oliver and Richard, called Protectors,
and to the Parliaments, judges and justices,
against us, full of lies, vilifying words and slanders;
but we got copies of them, and, through the Lord's
assistance, answered them all, and cleared the Lord's
truth and ourselves of them.</p>

<p>But oh! the body of darkness that rose against the
Truth in them that made lies their refuge! But the
Lord swept them away; and in and with His power,
truth, light, and life, hedged his lambs about, and
preserved them as on eagles' wings. Therefore we
all had, and have, great encouragement to trust the
Lord, who, we saw by His power and Spirit, overturned
and brought to naught all the confederacies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
and counsels that were hatched in darkness against
His Truth and people; and by the same truth gave
His people dominion, that therein they might serve
Him.</p>

<p>Indeed, I could not but take notice how the hand
of the Lord turned against the persecutors who had
been the cause of my imprisonment, or had been
abusive or cruel to me in it. The officer that fetched
me to Holker-Hall wasted his estate, and soon after
fled into Ireland. Most of the justices that were upon
the bench at the sessions when I was sent to prison,
died in a while after; as old Thomas Preston, Rawlinson,
Porter, and Matthew West, of Borwick. Justice
Fleming's wife died, and left him thirteen or
fourteen motherless children. Colonel Kirby never
prospered after. The chief constable, Richard Dodgson,
died soon after, and Mount, the petty constable,
and the wife of the other petty constable, John Ashburnham,
who railed at me in her house, died soon
after. William Knipe, the witness they brought
against me, died soon after also. Hunter, the jailer
of Lancaster, who was very wicked to me while I was
his prisoner, was cut off in his young days; and the
under-sheriff that carried me from Lancaster prison
towards Scarborough, lived not long after. And Joblin,
the jailer of Durham, who was prisoner with me
in Scarborough Castle, and had often incensed the
Governor and soldiers against me, though he got out
of prison, yet the Lord cut him off in his wickedness
soon after.</p>

<p>When I came into that country again, most of
those that dwelt in Lancashire were dead, and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
ruined in their estates; so that, though I did not seek
revenge upon them for their actings against me contrary
to the law, yet the Lord had executed His judgments
upon many of them.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">At the Work of Organizing.</p>

<h3>1667-1670.</h3>


<p>I then visited Friends till I came to York, where
we had a large meeting. After this I went to visit
Justice Robinson, an ancient justice of the peace,
who had been very loving to me and Friends from the
beginning.</p>

<p>There was a priest with him, who told me that it
was said of us, that we loved none but ourselves. I
told him that we loved all mankind, as they were
God's creation, and as they were children of Adam
and Eve by generation; and that we loved the brotherhood
in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>This stopped him. After some other discourse we
parted friendly, and passed away.</p>

<p>About this time I wrote a book, entitled, "Fear
God, and Honour the King"; in which I showed that
none could rightly fear God and honour the King but
they that departed from sin and evil. This book
greatly affected the soldiers, and most people.</p>

<p>Then I was moved of the Lord to recommend the
setting up of five monthly meetings of men and
women in the city of London (besides the women's
meetings and the quarterly meetings), to take care of
God's glory, and to admonish and exhort such as
walked disorderly or carelessly, and not according to
Truth. For whereas Friends had had only quarterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
meetings, now Truth was spread, and Friends were
grown more numerous, I was moved to recommend
the setting up of monthly meetings throughout the
nation.<a name="FNanchor_147_187" id="FNanchor_147_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_187" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> And the Lord opened to me what I must do,
and how the men's and women's monthly and quarterly
meetings should be ordered and established in
this and in other nations; and that I should write to
those where I did not come, to do the same.</p>

<p>After things were well settled at London, and the
Lord's Truth, power, seed, and life reigned and shone
over all in the city, I went into Essex.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Throughout the counties where he had preached, he
now went, setting up monthly meetings, i.e., local
meetings for transacting the business of the Church,
and for ordering and overseeing the moral and spiritual
life of the membership. We shall not follow his movements
in detail, but it may here be noted that the
world's records show few instances of more striking
energy, and fidelity to a divine mission, than do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
entries of these twenty-four years. Here is one glimpse
of him as he is traveling through "the frost and snow,"
during the winter of 1667.]</p></blockquote>

<p>I was so exceeding weak, I was hardly able to get
on or off my horse's back; but my spirit being earnestly
engaged in the work the Lord had concerned
me in and sent me forth about, I travelled on therein,
notwithstanding the weakness of my body, having
confidence in the Lord, that He would carry me
through, as He did by His power.</p>

<p>We came into Cheshire, where we had several
blessed meetings, and a general men's meeting;
wherein all the monthly meetings for that county
were settled, according to the gospel order, in and by
the power of God.</p>

<p>After the meeting I passed away. But when the
justices heard of it, they were very much troubled
that they had not come and broken it up, and taken
me; but the Lord prevented them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then, returning towards London by Waltham, I
advised the setting up of a school there for teaching
boys; and also a woman's school to be opened at
Shacklewell, for instructing girls and young maidens
in whatsoever things were civil and useful in the
creation.<a name="FNanchor_148_188" id="FNanchor_148_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_188" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Thus were the men's monthly meetings settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
through the nation. [1668.] The quarterly meetings
were generally settled before.</p>

<p>I wrote also into Ireland by faithful Friends, and
into Scotland, Holland, Barbadoes, and several parts
of America, advising Friends to settle their men's
monthly meetings in those countries. For they had
had their general quarterly meetings before; but now
that Truth was increased amongst them, it was needful
that they should settle those men's monthly meetings
in the power and Spirit of God, that first convinced
them.</p>

<p>Since these meetings have been settled, and all the
faithful in the power of God, who are heirs of the
gospel, have met together in the power of God, which
is their authority, to perform service to the Lord,
many mouths have been opened in thanksgiving and
praise, and many have blessed the Lord God, that
ever He sent me forth in this service. For now all
coming to have a concern and care for God's honour
and glory, and His name, which they profess, be not
blasphemed; and to see that all who profess the Truth
walk in the Truth, in righteousness and in holiness,
as becomes the house of God, and that all order their
conversation aright, that they may see the salvation
of God; they may all see and know, possess and partake
of, the government of Christ, of the increase of
which there is to be no end.</p>

<p>Thus the Lord's everlasting renown and praise are
set up in the heart of every one that is faithful; so
that we can say the gospel order established amongst
us is not of man, nor by man, but of and by Jesus
Christ, in and through the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>This order of the gospel, which is not of man nor
by man, but from Christ, the heavenly man, is above
all the orders of men in the fall, whether Jews, Gentiles,
or apostate Christians, and will remain when
they are gone. For the power of God, which is the
everlasting gospel, was before the devil was, and will
be and remain forever. And as the everlasting gospel
was preached in the apostles' days to all nations,
that all nations might, through the divine power
which brings life and immortality to light, come into
the order of it, so now the everlasting gospel is to be,
and is, preached again, as John the divine foresaw it
should be, to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now<a name="FNanchor_AO_189" id="FNanchor_AO_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_189" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> was I moved of the Lord to go over
into Ireland, to visit the Seed of God in that nation.
There went with me Robert Lodge, James Lancaster,
Thomas Briggs, and John Stubbs.</p>

<p>We waited near Liverpool for shipping and wind.
After waiting some days, we sent James Lancaster
to take passage, which he did, and brought word the
ship was ready, and would take us in at Black Rock.
We went thither on foot; and it being some distance,
and the weather very hot, I was much spent with
walking.</p>

<p>When we arrived, the ship was not there; so we
were obliged to go to the town and take shipping.
When we were on board, I said to the rest of my
company, "Come, ye will triumph in the Lord, for
we shall have fair wind and weather."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>Many passengers in the ship were sick, but not one
of our company. The captain and many of the passengers
were very loving; and we being at sea on the
first day of the week, I was moved to declare Truth
among them; whereupon the captain said to the passengers,
"Here are things that you never heard in
your lives."</p>

<p>When we came before Dublin, we took boat and
went ashore; and the earth and air smelt, methought,
of the corruption of the nation, so that it yielded another
smell to me than England did; which I imputed
to the Popish massacres that had been committed,
and the blood that had been spilt in it, from which a
foulness ascended.</p>

<p>We passed through among the officers of the custom
four times, yet they did not search us; for they
perceived what we were: some of them were so envious
they did not care to look at us.</p>

<p>We did not soon find Friends; but went to an inn,
and sent out to inquire for some. These, when they
came to us, were exceedingly glad of our coming, and
received us with great joy.</p>

<p>We stayed there the weekly meeting, which was a
large one, and the power and life of God appeared
greatly in it. Afterwards we passed to a province
meeting, which lasted two days, there being one about
the poor, and another meeting more general; in
which a mighty power of the Lord appeared. Truth
was livingly declared, and Friends were much refreshed
therein.</p>

<p>Passing thence about four and twenty miles, we
came to another place, where we had a very good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
refreshing meeting; but after it some Papists that
were there were angry, and raged very much. When
I heard of it, I sent for one of them, who was a
schoolmaster; but he would not come.</p>

<p>Thereupon I sent a challenge to him, with all the
friars and monks, priests and Jesuits, to come forth,
and "try their God and their Christ, which they had
made of bread and wine," but no answer could I get
from them. I told them they were worse than the
priests of Baal; for Baal's priests tried their wooden
god, but these durst not try their god of bread and
wine; and Baal's priests and people did not eat their
god as these did, and then make another.</p>

<p>He that was then mayor of Cork, being very envious
against Truth and Friends, had many Friends
in prison. Knowing I was in the country, he sent
four warrants to take me; therefore Friends were desirous
that I should not ride through Cork. But,
being at Bandon, there appeared to me in a vision a
very ugly-visaged man, of a black and dark look. My
spirit struck at him in the power of God, and it
seemed to me that I rode over him with my horse,
and my horse set his foot on the side of his face.</p>

<p>When I came down in the morning, I told a friend
the command of the Lord to me was to ride through
Cork; but I bade him tell no man. So we took horse,
many Friends being with me.</p>

<p>When we came near the town, Friends would have
shown me a way through the back side of it; but I
told them my way was through the streets. Taking
Paul Morrice to guide me through the town, I rode
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>As we rode through the market-place, and by the
mayor's door, he, seeing me, said, "There goes
George Fox"; but he had not power to stop me.
When we had passed the sentinels, and were come
over the bridge, we went to a Friend's house and
alighted. There the Friends told me what a rage
was in the town, and how many warrants were granted
to take me.</p>

<p>While I was sitting there I felt the evil spirit at
work in the town, stirring up mischief against me;
and I felt the power of the Lord strike at that evil
spirit.</p>

<p>By-and-by some other friends coming in, told me
it was over the town, and amongst the magistrates
that I was in the town. I said, "Let the devil do his
worst." After we had refreshed ourselves, I called
for my horse, and having a Friend to guide me, we
went on our way.</p>

<p>Great was the rage that the mayor and others of
Cork were in that they had missed me, and great
pains they afterwards took to catch me, having their
scouts abroad upon the roads, as I understood, to observe
which way I went. Scarce a public meeting
I came to, but spies came to watch if I were there.
The magistrates and priests sent informations one to
another concerning me, describing me by my hair,
hat, clothes and horse; so that when I was near an
hundred miles from Cork they had an account concerning
me and a description of me before I came
amongst them.</p>

<p>One very envious magistrate, who was both a
priest and a justice, got a warrant from the judge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
assize to apprehend me. The warrant was to go over
all his circuit, which reached near an hundred miles.
Yet the Lord disappointed all their councils, defeated
all their designs against me, and by His good hand of
Providence preserved me out of all their snares, and
gave us many sweet and blessed opportunities to visit
Friends, and spread Truth through that nation.</p>

<p>For meetings were very large, Friends coming to
them from far and near; and other people flocking in.
The powerful presence of the Lord was preciously
felt amongst us. Many of the world were reached,
convinced, and gathered to the Truth; the Lord's
flock was increased; and Friends were greatly refreshed
and comforted in feeling the love of God.
Oh the brokenness that was amongst them in the
flowings of life! so that, in the power and Spirit of
the Lord, many together broke out into singing, even
with audible voices, making melody in their hearts.</p>

<p>After I had travelled over Ireland, and visited
Friends in their meetings, as well for business as for
worship, and had answered several papers and writings
from monks, friars, and Protestant priests (for
they were all in a rage against us, and endeavoured
to stop the work of the Lord, and some Jesuits swore
in our hearing that we had come to spread our principles
in that nation, but should not do it), I returned
to Dublin, in order to take passage for England. I
stayed to the First-day's meeting there, which was
very large and precious.</p>

<p>There being a ship ready, and the wind serving,
we took our leave of Friends; parting in much tenderness
and brokenness, in the sense of the heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
life and power manifested amongst us. Having put
our horses and necessaries on board in the morning,
we went ourselves in the afternoon, many Friends accompanying
us to the ship; and divers Friends and
Friendly people followed us in boats when we were
near a league at sea, their love drawing them, though
not without danger.</p>

<p>A good, weighty, and true people there is in that
nation, sensible of the power of the Lord God, and
tender of His truth. Very good order they have in
their meetings; for they stand up for righteousness
and holiness, which dams up the way of wickedness.
A precious visitation they had, and there is an excellent
spirit in them, worthy to be visited. Many
things more I could write of that nation, and of my
travels in it; but thus much I thought good to signify,
that the righteous may rejoice in the prosperity of
truth.</p>

<p>We travelled till we came to Bristol, where I met
with Margaret Fell, who was come to visit her daughter
Yeomans.</p>

<p>I had seen from the Lord a considerable time before,
that I should take Margaret Fell to be my wife.
And when I first mentioned it to her, she felt the answer
of Life from God thereunto. But though the
Lord had opened this thing to me, yet I had not received
a command from the Lord for the accomplishing
of it then. Wherefore I let the thing rest, and
went on in the work and service of the Lord as before,
according as he led me; travelling up and down
in this nation, and through Ireland.</p>

<p>But now being at Bristol, and finding Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
Fell there, it opened in me from the Lord that the
thing should be accomplished. After we had discoursed
the matter together, I told her, if she also
was satisfied with the accomplishing of it now, she
should first send for her children; which she did.
When the rest of her daughters were come, I asked
both them and her sons-in-law if they had anything
against it, or for it; and they all severally expressed
their satisfaction therein.</p>

<p>Then I asked Margaret if she had fulfilled and performed
her husband's will to her children. She replied,
"The children know that." Whereupon I
asked them whether, if their mother married, they
would lose by it. And I asked Margaret whether
she had done anything in lieu of it, which might answer
it to the children.</p>

<p>The children said she had answered it to them, and
desired me to speak no more of it. I told them I was
plain, and would have all things done plainly; for I
sought not any outward advantage to myself.</p>

<p>So, after I had thus acquainted the children with
it, our intention of marriage was laid before Friends,
both privately and publicly, to their full satisfaction.
Many of them gave testimony thereunto that it was
of God. Afterwards, a meeting being appointed for
the accomplishing thereof, in the meeting-house at
Broad-Mead, in Bristol, we took each other, the Lord
joining us together in honourable marriage, in the
everlasting covenant and immortal Seed of life. In
the sense thereof living and weighty testimonies were
borne thereunto by Friends, in the movings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
heavenly power which united us.<a name="FNanchor_149_190" id="FNanchor_149_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_190" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Then was a certificate,
relating both the proceedings and the marriage,
openly read, and signed by the relations, and by most
of the ancient Friends of that city, besides many others
from divers parts of the nation.</p>

<p>We stayed about a week in Bristol, and then went
together to Oldstone: where, taking leave of each
other in the Lord, we parted, betaking ourselves each
to our several service; Margaret returning homewards
to the north, and I passing on in the work of
the Lord as before. I travelled through Wiltshire,
Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and so to
London, visiting Friends: in all of which counties I
had many large and precious meetings.<a name="FNanchor_150_191" id="FNanchor_150_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_191" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[In 1670 the so-called Conventicle Act, originally
passed in 1664, was renewed with increased vigor. The
Act limited religious gatherings, other than those of the
Established Church, to five persons, and brought all
who refused to take an oath under the penalties of the
Act.]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>On the First-day after the Act came in force, I
went to the meeting at Gracechurch Street, where I
expected the storm was most likely to begin.</p>

<p>When I came there, I found the street full of people,
and a guard set to keep Friends out of their meeting-house.
I went to the other passage out of Lombard
street, where also I found a guard; but the court
was full of people, and a Friend was speaking
amongst them; but he did not speak long.</p>

<p>When he had done, I stood up, and was moved to
say, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is
hard for thee to kick against that which pricks
thee." Then I showed that it is Saul's nature that
persecutes still, and that they who persecute Christ
in His members now, where He is made manifest,
kick against that which pricks them; that it was the
birth of the flesh that persecuted the birth born of
the Spirit, and that it was the nature of dogs to tear
and devour the sheep; but that we suffered as sheep,
that bite not again, for we were a peaceable people,
and loved them that persecuted us.</p>

<p>After I had spoken a while to this effect, the constable
came with an informer and soldiers; and as
they pulled me down, I said, "Blessed are the peacemakers."</p>

<p>The commander put me among the soldiers, and
bade them secure me, saying to me, "You are the
man I looked for." They took also John Burnyeat
and another Friend, and led us away, first to the Exchange,
and afterwards towards Moorfields. As we
went along the streets the people were very moderate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
some of them laughed at the constable, and told
him we would not run away.</p>

<p>The informer went with us unknown, till, falling
into discourse with one of the company, he said it
would never be a good world till all people came to
the good old religion that was two hundred years ago.
Whereupon I asked him, "Art thou a Papist? What!
a Papist informer; for two hundred years ago there
was no other religion but that of the Papists."</p>

<p>He saw he had ensnared himself, and was vexed at
it; for as he went along the streets I spoke often to
him, and manifested what he was.</p>

<p>When we were come to the mayor's house, and
were in the courtyard, several of the people that
stood about, asked me how and for what I was taken.
I desired them to ask the informer, and also what his
name was; but he refused to tell his name. Whereupon
one of the mayor's officers, looking out at a window,
told him he should tell his name before he went
away; for the lord mayor would know by what authority
he intruded himself with soldiers into the
execution of those laws which belonged to the civil
magistrate to execute, and not to the military.</p>

<p>After this, he was eager to be gone; and went to
the porter to be let out. One of the officers called to
him, saying, "Have you brought people here to inform
against, and now will you go away before my
lord mayor comes?" Some called to the porter not
to let him out; whereupon he forcibly pulled open the
door and slipped out.</p>

<p>No sooner was he come into the street than the
people gave a shout that made the street ring again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
crying out, "A Papist informer! a Papist informer!"
We desired the constable and soldiers to
go and rescue him out of the people's hands, fearing
lest they should do him a mischief.</p>

<p>They went, and brought him into the mayor's entry,
where they stayed a while; but when he went out
again, the people received him with another shout.
The soldiers were fain to go and rescue him once
more, and they led him into a house in an alley,
where they persuaded him to change his periwig, and
so he got away unknown.</p>

<p>When the mayor came, we were brought into the
room where he was, and some of his officers would
have taken off our hats, perceiving which he called to
them, and bade them let us alone, and not meddle
with our hats; "for," said he, "they are not yet
brought before me in judicature." So we stood by
while he examined some Presbyterian and Baptist
teachers; with whom he was somewhat sharp, and
convicted them.</p>

<p>After he had done with them, I was brought up to
the table where he sat; and then the officers took off
my hat. The mayor said mildly to me, "Mr. Fox,
you are an eminent man amongst those of your profession;
pray, will you be instrumental to dissuade
them from meeting in such great numbers? for, seeing
Christ hath promised that where two or three are
met in His name, He will be in the midst of them,
and the King and Parliament are graciously pleased
to allow four to meet together to worship God; why
will not you be content to partake both of Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
promise to two or three, and the King's indulgence
to four?"<a name="FNanchor_151_192" id="FNanchor_151_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_192" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>I answered to this purpose: "Christ's promise was
not to discourage many from meeting together in His
name, but to encourage the few, that the fewest
might not forbear to meet because of their fewness.
But if Christ hath promised to manifest His presence
in the midst of so small an assembly, where but two
or three are gathered in His name, how much more
would His presence abound where two or three hundred
are gathered in His name?"</p>

<p>I wished him to consider whether this Act, if it had
been in their time, would not have taken hold of
Christ, with His twelve apostles and seventy disciples,
who used to meet often together, and that with
great numbers? However, I told him this Act
did not concern us; for it was made against seditious
meetings, of such as met under colour and pretence
of religion "to contrive insurrections, as [the Act
says] late experience had shown." But we had been
sufficiently tried and proved, and always found peaceable,
and therefore he would do well to put a difference
between the innocent and the guilty.</p>

<p>He said the Act was made against meetings, and a
worship not according to the liturgy.</p>

<p>I told him "according to" was not the very same
thing; and asked him whether the liturgy was according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
to the Scriptures, and whether we might not read
Scriptures and speak Scriptures.</p>

<p>He said, "Yes."</p>

<p>I told him, "This Act takes hold only of such as
meet to plot and contrive insurrections, as late experience
hath shown; but they have never experienced
that by us. Because thieves are sometimes on
the road, must not honest men travel? And because
plotters and contrivers have met to do mischief, must
not an honest, peaceable people meet to do good? If
we had been a people that met to plot and contrive
insurrections, etc., we might have drawn ourselves
into fours; for four might do more mischief in plotting
than if there were four hundred, because four
might speak out their minds more freely to one another
than four hundred could. Therefore we, being
innocent, and not the people this Act concerns, keep
our meetings as we used to do. I believe thou knowest
in thy conscience that we are innocent."</p>

<p>After some more discourse, he took our names, and
the places where we lodged; and at length, as the informer
was gone, he set us at liberty.</p>

<p>The Friends with me now asked, "Whither wilt
thou go?" I told them, "To Gracechurch street
meeting again, if it is not over."</p>

<p>When we came there, the people were generally
gone; only some few stood at the gate. We went
into Gerrard Roberts's. Thence I sent to know how
the other meetings in the city were. I found that at
some of the meeting-places Friends had been kept
out; at others they had been taken; but these were
set at liberty again a few days after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>A glorious time it was; for the Lord's power came
over all, and His everlasting truth got renown. For
in the meetings, as fast as some that were speaking
were taken down, others were moved of the Lord to
stand up and speak, to the admiration of the people;
and the more because many Baptists and other sectaries
left their public meetings, and came to see how
the Quakers would stand.</p>

<p>As for the informer aforesaid, he was so frightened
that hardly any informer dared to appear publicly in
London for some time after. But the mayor, whose
name was Samuel Starling, though he carried himself
smoothly towards us, proved afterwards a very
great persecutor of our Friends, many of whom he
cast into prison, as may be seen in the trials of William
Penn, William Mead, and others, at the Old
Bailey this year.<a name="FNanchor_152_193" id="FNanchor_152_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_193" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I was walking down a hill,<a name="FNanchor_AP_194" id="FNanchor_AP_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_194" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> a great weight and
oppression fell upon my spirit. I got on my horse
again, but the weight remained so that I was hardly
able to ride.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>
<p>At length we came to Rochester, but I was much
spent, being so extremely laden and burthened with
the world's spirits, that my life was oppressed under
them. I got with difficulty to Gravesend, and lay at
an inn there; but could hardly either eat or sleep.</p>

<p>The next day John Rous and Alexander Parker
went to London; and John Stubbs being come to me,
we went over the ferry into Essex. We came to
Hornchurch, where there was a meeting on First-day.
After it I rode with great uneasiness to Stratford, to
a Friend's house, whose name was Williams, and who
had formerly been a captain. Here I lay, exceedingly
weak, and at last lost both hearing and sight.
Several Friends came to me from London: and I told
them that I should be a sign to such as would not
see, and such as would not hear the Truth.<a name="FNanchor_153_195" id="FNanchor_153_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_195" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>In this condition I continued some time. Several
came about me; and though I could not see their persons,
I felt and discerned their spirits, who were honest-hearted,
and who were not. Divers Friends who
practised physic came to see me, and would have given
me medicines, but I was not to meddle with any; for
I was sensible I had a travail to go through; and
therefore desired none but solid, weighty Friends
might be about me.</p>

<p>Under great sufferings and travails, sorrows and
oppressions, I lay for several weeks, whereby I was
brought so low and weak in body that few thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
could live. Some that were with me went away, saying
they would not see me die; and it was reported
both in London and in the country that I was deceased;
but I felt the Lord's power inwardly supporting
me.</p>

<p>When they that were about me had given me up to
die, I spoke to them to get a coach to carry me to
Gerrard Roberts's, about twelve miles off, for I found
it was my place to go thither. I had now recovered
a little glimmering of sight, so that I could discern
the people and fields as I went, and that was all.</p>

<p>When I came to Gerrard's, he was very weak, and
I was moved to speak to him, and encourage him.
After I had stayed about three weeks there, it was
with me to go to Enfield. Friends were afraid of my
removing; but I told them I might safely go.</p>

<p>When I had taken my leave of Gerrard, and was
come to Enfield, I went first to visit Amor Stoddart,
who lay very weak and almost speechless. I was
moved to tell him that he had been faithful as a man,
and faithful to God, and that the immortal Seed of
life was his crown. Many more words I was moved
to speak to him, though I was then so weak I was
hardly able to stand; and within a few days after,
Amor died.</p>

<p>I went to the widow Dry's, at Enfield, where I lay
all that winter, warring in spirit with the evil spirits
of the world, that warred against Truth and Friends.
For there were great persecutions at this time; some
meeting-houses were pulled down, and many were
broken up by soldiers. Sometimes a troop of horse,
or a company of foot came; and some broke their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
swords, carbines, muskets, and pikes, with beating
Friends; and many they wounded, so that their blood
lay in the streets.</p>

<p>Amongst others that were active in this cruel persecution
at London, my old adversary, Colonel Kirby,
was one. With a company of foot, he went to break
up several meetings; and he would often inquire for
me at the meetings he broke up. One time as he
went over the water to Horsleydown, there happening
some scuffle between some of his soldiers and
some of the watermen, he bade his men fire at them.
They did so, and killed some.</p>

<p>I was under great sufferings at this time, beyond
what I have words to declare. For I was brought
into the deep, and saw all the religions of the world,
and people that lived in them. And I saw the priests
that held them up; who were as a company of men-eaters,
eating up the people like bread, and gnawing
the flesh from off their bones. But as for true religion,
and worship, and ministers of God, alack! I saw
there was none amongst those of the world that pretended
to it.</p>

<p>Though it was a cruel, bloody, persecuting time,
yet the Lord's power went over all, His everlasting
Seed prevailed; and Friends were made to stand firm
and faithful in the Lord's power. Some sober people
of other professions would say, "If Friends did not
stand, the nation would run into debauchery."</p>

<p>Though by reason of my weakness I could not
travel amongst Friends as I had been used to do, yet
in the motion of life I sent the following lines as an
encouraging testimony to them:</p>


<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>

"My dear Friends:<br />
</p>

<p>"The Seed is above all. In it walk; in which ye
all have life.</p>

<p>"Be not amazed at the weather; for always the
just suffered by the unjust, but the just had the dominion.</p>

<p>"All along ye may see, by faith the mountains
were subdued; and the rage of the wicked, with his
fiery darts, was quenched. Though the waves and
storms be high, yet your faith will keep you, so
as to swim above them; for they are but for a time,
and the Truth is without time. Therefore keep on
the mountain of holiness, ye who are led to it by
the Light.</p>

<p>"Do not think that anything will outlast the
Truth. For the Truth standeth sure; and is over that
which is out of the Truth. For the good will overcome
the evil; the light, darkness; the life, death;
virtue, vice; and righteousness, unrighteousness. The
false prophet cannot overcome the true; but the true
prophet, Christ, will overcome all the false.</p>

<p>"So be faithful, and live in that which doth not
think the time long.</p>

<p class="signature">
G. F."
</p></blockquote>

<p>After some time it pleased the Lord to allay the
heat of this violent persecution; and I felt in spirit
an overcoming of the spirits of those men-eaters that
had stirred it up and carried it on to that height of
cruelty. I was outwardly very weak; and I plainly
felt, and those Friends that were with me, and that
came to visit me, took notice, that as the persecution
ceased I came from under the travails and sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
that had lain with such weight upon me; so that towards
the spring I began to recover, and to walk up
and down, beyond the expectation of many, who did
not think I could ever have gone abroad again.</p>

<p>Whilst I was under this spiritual suffering the state
of the New Jerusalem which comes down out of
heaven was opened to me; which some carnal-minded
people had looked upon to be like an outward city
dropped out of the elements. I saw the beauty and
glory of it, the length, the breadth, and the height
thereof, all in complete proportion. I saw that all
who are within the Light of Christ, and in His faith,
of which He is the author; and in the Spirit, the Holy
Ghost, which Christ and the holy prophets and apostles
were in; and within the grace, and truth, and
power of God, which are the walls of the city;&mdash;I
saw that such are within the city, are members of it,
and have right to eat of the Tree of Life, which
yields her fruit every month, and whose leaves are
for the healing of the nations.</p>

<p>Many things more did I see concerning the heavenly
city, the New Jerusalem, which are hard to be
uttered, and would be hard to be received. But, in
short, this holy city is within the Light, and all that
are within the Light, are within the city: the gates
whereof stand open all the day (for there is no night
there), that all may come in.</p>

<p class="center oldenglish">Two Years in America.</p>

<h3>1671-1673.</h3>


<p>When I received notice of my wife's being taken
to prison again,<a name="FNanchor_154_196" id="FNanchor_154_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_196" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> I sent two of her daughters to the
King, and they procured his order to the sheriff of
Lancashire for her discharge. But though I expected
she would have been set at liberty, yet this violent
storm of persecution coming suddenly on, the persecutors
there found means to hold her still in prison.</p>

<p>But now the persecution a little ceasing, I was
moved to speak to Martha Fisher, and another woman
Friend, to go to the King about her liberty.
They went in the faith, and in the Lord's power; and
He gave them favour with the King, so that he granted
a discharge under the broad seal, to clear both her
and her estate, after she had been ten years a prisoner,
and præmunired; the like whereof was scarce
to be heard in England.</p>

<p>I sent down the discharge forthwith by a Friend;
by whom also I wrote to her, to inform her how to
get it delivered to the justices, and also to acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
her that it was upon me from the Lord to go beyond
sea, to visit the plantations in America; and therefore
I desired her to hasten to London, as soon as she
could conveniently after she had obtained her liberty,
because the ship was then fitting for the voyage.</p>

<p>In the meantime I got to Kingston, and stayed at
John Rous's till my wife came up, and then I began
to prepare for the voyage. But the yearly meeting<a name="FNanchor_155_197" id="FNanchor_155_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_197" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
being near at hand, I tarried till that was over.
Many Friends came up to it from all parts of the nation,
and a very large and precious meeting it was;
for the Lord's power was over all, and His glorious,
everlastingly-renowned Seed of Life was exalted
above all.</p>

<p>After this meeting was over, and I had finished my
services for the Lord in England, the ship and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
Friends that intended to go with me being ready, I
went to Gravesend on the 12th of Sixth month,<a name="FNanchor_156_198" id="FNanchor_156_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_198" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> my
wife and several Friends accompanying me to the
Downs.</p>

<p>We went from Wapping in a barge to the ship,
which lay a little below Gravesend, and there we
found the Friends that were bound for the voyage
with me, who had gone down to the ship the night
before. Their names were Thomas Briggs, William
Edmundson, John Rous, John Stubbs, Solomon Eccles,
James Lancaster, John Cartwright, Robert Widders,
George Pattison, John Hull, Elizabeth Hooton,
and Elizabeth Miers. The vessel was a yacht, called
the <em>Industry</em>; the captain's name Thomas Forster,
and the number of passengers about fifty.</p>

<p>I lay that night on board, but most of the Friends
at Gravesend. Early next morning the passengers,
and those Friends that intended to accompany us to
the Downs, being come on board, we took our leave
in great tenderness of those that came with us to
Gravesend only, and set sail about six in the morning
for the Downs.</p>

<p>Having a fair wind, we out-sailed all the ships that
were outward-bound, and got thither by evening.
Some of us went ashore that night, and lodged at
Deal, where, we understood, an officer had orders
from the governor to take our names in writing,
which he did next morning, though we told him they
had been taken at Gravesend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon, the wind serving, I took leave of
my wife and other Friends, and went on board. Before
we could sail, there being two of the King's frigates
riding in the Downs, the captain of one of them
sent his press-master on board us, who took three of
our seamen. This would certainly have delayed, if
not wholly prevented, our voyage, had not the captain
of the other frigate, being informed of the leakiness
of our vessel, and the length of our voyage, in
compassion and much civility, spared us two of his
own men.</p>

<p>Before this was over, a custom-house officer came
on board to peruse packets and get fees; so that we
were kept from sailing till about sunset; during which
delay a very considerable number of merchantmen,
outward-bound, were several leagues before us.</p>

<p>Being clear, we set sail in the evening, and next
morning overtook part of that fleet about the height
of Dover. We soon reached the rest, and in a little
time left them all behind; for our yacht was counted
a very swift sailer. But she was very leaky, so that
the seamen and some of the passengers did, for the
most part, pump day and night. One day they observed
that in two hours' time she sucked in sixteen
inches of water in the well.</p>

<p>When we had been about three weeks at sea, one
afternoon we spied a vessel about four leagues astern
of us. Our master said it was a Sallee<a name="FNanchor_157_199" id="FNanchor_157_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_199" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> man-of-war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
that seemed to give us chase. He said, "Come, let us
go to supper, and when it grows dark we shall lose
him." This he spoke to please and pacify the passengers,
some of whom began to be very apprehensive
of the danger. But Friends were well satisfied in
themselves, having faith in God, and no fear upon
their spirits.</p>

<p>When the sun was gone down, I saw out of my
cabin the ship making towards us. When it grew
dark, we altered our course to miss her; but she altered
also, and gained upon us.</p>

<p>At night the master and others came into my
cabin, and asked me what they should do. I told
them I was no mariner; and I asked them what they
thought was best to do. They said there were but
two ways, either to outrun him, or to tack about, and
hold the same course we were going before. I told
them that if he were a thief, they might be sure he
would tack about too; and as for outrunning him, it
was to no purpose to talk of that, for they saw he
sailed faster than we. They asked me again what they
should do, "for," they said, "if the mariners had
taken Paul's counsel, they had not come to the damage
they did." I answered that it was a trial of faith,
and therefore the Lord was to be waited on for
counsel.</p>

<p>So, retiring in spirit, the Lord showed me that His
life and power were placed between us and the ship
that pursued us. I told this to the master and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
rest, and that the best way was to tack about and
steer our right course. I desired them also to put out
all their candles but the one they steered by, and to
speak to all the passengers to be still and quiet.</p>

<p>About eleven at night the watch called and said
they were just upon us. This disquieted some of the
passengers. I sat up in my cabin, and, looking
through the port-hole, the moon being not quite
down, I saw them very near us. I was getting up to
go out of the cabin; but remembering the word of
the Lord, that His life and power were placed between
us and them, I lay down again.</p>

<p>The master and some of the seamen came again,
and asked me if they might not steer such a point.
I told them they might do as they would.</p>

<p>By this time the moon was quite down. A fresh
gale arose, and the Lord hid us from them; we sailed
briskly on and saw them no more.</p>

<p>The next day, being the first day of the week, we
had a public meeting in the ship, as we usually had
on that day throughout the voyage, and the Lord's
presence was greatly among us. I desired the people
to remember the mercies of the Lord, who had delivered
them; for they might have been all in
the Turks' hands by that time, had not the Lord's
hand saved them.</p>

<p>About a week after, the master and some of the
seamen endeavoured to persuade the passengers that
it was not a Turkish pirate that had chased us, but a
merchantman going to the Canaries. When I heard
of it I asked them, "Why then did you speak so to
me? Why did you trouble the passengers? and why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
did you tack about from him and alter your course?"
I told them they should take heed of slighting the
mercies of God.</p>

<p>Afterwards, while we were at Barbadoes, there
came in a merchant from Sallee, and told the people
that one of the Sallee men-of-war saw a monstrous
yacht at sea, the greatest that ever he saw, and had
her in chase, and was just upon her, but that there
was a spirit in her that he could not take. This confirmed
us in the belief that it was a Sallee-man we
saw make after us, and that it was the Lord that delivered
us out of his hands.</p>

<p>The third of the Eighth month, early in the morning,
we discovered the island of Barbadoes; but it
was between nine and ten at night ere we came to
anchor in Carlisle bay.</p>

<p>We got on shore as soon as we could, and I with
some others walked to the house of a Friend, a merchant,
whose name was Richard Forstall, above a
quarter of a mile from the bridge. But being very ill
and weak, I was so tired, that I was in a manner spent
by the time I got thither. There I abode very ill
several days, and though they several times gave me
things to make me sweat, they could not effect it.
What they gave me did rather parch and dry up my
body, and made me probably worse than otherwise
I might have been.</p>

<p>Thus I continued about three weeks after I landed,
having much pain in my bones, joints, and whole
body, so that I could hardly get any rest; yet I was
pretty cheery, and my spirit kept above it all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
Neither did my illness take me off from the service
of Truth; but both while I was at sea, and after I
came to Barbadoes, before I was able to travel about,
I gave forth several papers (having a Friend to write
for me), some of which I sent by the first conveyance
for England to be printed.</p>

<p>Soon after I came into the island, I was informed
of a remarkable passage, wherein the justice of God
did eminently appear. It was thus. There was a
young man of Barbadoes whose name was John
Drakes, a person of some note in the world's account,
but a common swearer and a bad man, who, when he
was in London, had a mind to marry a Friend's daughter,
left by her mother very young, with a considerable
portion, to the care and government of several
Friends, whereof I was one. He made application to
me that he might have my consent to marry this
young maid.</p>

<p>I told him I was one of her overseers, appointed by
her mother, who was a widow, to take care of her;
that if her mother had intended her for a match to
any man of another profession, she would have disposed
her accordingly; but she committed her to us,
that she might be trained up in the fear of the Lord;
and therefore I should betray the trust reposed in
me if I should consent that he, who was out of the
fear of God, should marry her; and this I would not
do.</p>

<p>When he saw that he could not obtain his desire,
he returned to Barbadoes with great offence of mind
against me, but without a just cause. Afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
when he heard I was coming to Barbadoes, he swore
desperately, and threatened that if he could possibly
procure it, he would have me burned to death when
I came there. A Friend hearing of this, asked him
what I had done to him that he was so violent against
me. He would not answer, but said again, "I'll have
him burned." Whereupon the Friend replied, "Do
not march on too furiously, lest thou come too soon
to thy journey's end."</p>

<p>About ten days after he was struck with a violent,
burning fever, of which he died; by which his body
was so scorched that the people said it was as black
as a coal; and three days before I landed his body was
laid in the dust. This was taken notice of as a sad example.</p>

<p>While I continued so weak that I could not go
abroad to meetings, the other Friends that came over
with me bestirred themselves in the Lord's work.
The next day but one after we came on shore, they
had a great meeting at the Bridge, and after that
several meetings in different parts of the island;
which alarmed the people of all sorts, so that many
came to our meetings, and some of the chiefest rank.
For they had got my name, understanding I was come
upon the island, and expected to see me, not knowing
I was unable to go abroad.</p>

<p>And indeed my weakness continued the longer on
me, because my spirit was much pressed down at the
first with the filth and dirt, and with the unrighteousness
of the people, which lay as an heavy weight and
load upon me. But after I had been above a month
upon the island my spirit became somewhat easier; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
began to recover my health and strength, and to get
abroad among Friends.<a name="FNanchor_158_200" id="FNanchor_158_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_200" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>After I was able to go about, and had been a little
amongst Friends, I went to visit the Governor, Lewis
Morice, Thomas Rous, and some other Friends being
with me. He received us very civilly, and treated
us very kindly, making us dine with him, and keeping
us the greater part of the day before he let us go
away.</p>

<p>The same week I went to Bridgetown. There was
to be a general meeting of Friends that week; and
the visit I had made to the Governor, and the kind reception
I had with him, being generally known to
the officers, civil and military, many came to this
meeting from most parts of the island, and those not
of the meanest rank; several being judges or justices,
colonels or captains; so that a very great meeting we
had, both of Friends and others.</p>

<p>The Lord's blessed power was plentifully with us;
and although I was somewhat straitened for time,
three other Friends having spoken before me, yet the
Lord opened things through me to the general and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
great satisfaction of them that were present. Colonel
Lewis Morice came to this meeting, and with
him a neighbour of his, a judge in the country, whose
name was Ralph Fretwell, who was very well satisfied,
and received the Truth.</p>

<p>Paul Gwin, a jangling Baptist, came into the meeting,
and asked me how I spelt Cain, and whether I
had the same spirit as the apostles had. I told him,
"Yes." And he bade the judge take notice of it.</p>

<p>I told him, "He that hath not a measure of the
same Holy Ghost as the apostles had, is possessed
with an unclean spirit." And then he went his way.</p>

<p>We had many great and precious meetings, both
for worship and for the affairs of the Church; to the
former of which many of other societies came. At
one of these meetings Colonel Lyne, a sober person,
was so well satisfied with what I declared that he
said, "Now I can gainsay such as I have heard speak
evil of you; who say, you do not own Christ, nor that
He died; whereas I perceive you exalt Christ in all
His offices beyond what I have ever heard before."<a name="FNanchor_159_201" id="FNanchor_159_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_201" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>
<p>As I had been to visit the Governor as soon as I
was well able, after I came thither, so, when I was at
Thomas Rous's, the Governor came to see me, carrying
himself very courteously.</p>

<p>Having been three months or more in Barbadoes,
and having visited Friends, thoroughly settled meetings,
and despatched the service for which the Lord
brought me thither, I felt my spirit clear of that island,
and found drawings to Jamaica. When I had
communicated this to Friends, I acquainted the Governor
also, and divers of his council, that I intended
shortly to leave the island, and go to Jamaica. This
I did that, as my coming thither was open and public,
so my departure also might be. Before I left the
island I wrote the following letter to my wife, that
she might understand both how it was with me, and
how I proceeded in my travels:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear Heart</span>,
</p>

<p>"To whom is my love, and to all the children, in
the Seed of Life that changeth not, but is over all;
blessed be the Lord forever. I have undergone great
sufferings in my body and spirit, beyond words; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
the God of heaven be praised, His Truth is over all.
I am now well; and, if the Lord permit, within a few
days I pass from Barbadoes towards Jamaica; and I
think to stay but little there. I desire that ye may
be all kept free in the Seed of Life, out of all cumbrances.
Friends are generally well. Remember me
to Friends that inquire after me. So no more, but
my love in the Seed and Life that changeth not.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>I set sail from Barbadoes to Jamaica on the 8th
of the Eleventh month, 1671; Robert Widders, William
Edmundson, Solomon Eccles and Elizabeth
Hooton going with me. Thomas Briggs and John
Stubbs remained in Barbadoes, with whom were
John Rous and William Bailey.</p>

<p>We had a quick and easy passage to Jamaica,
where we met again with our Friends James Lancaster,
John Cartwright, and George Pattison, who had
been labouring there in the service of Truth; into
which we forthwith entered with them, travelling up
and down through the island, which is large; and a
brave country it is, though the people are, many of
them, debauched and wicked.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA

</div>

<p>We had much service. There was a great convincement,
and many received the Truth, some of
whom were people of account in the world. We had
many meetings there, which were large, and very
quiet. The people were civil to us, so that not a
mouth was opened against us. I was twice with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
Governor, and some other magistrates, who all carried
themselves kindly towards me.</p>

<p>About a week after we landed in Jamaica, Elizabeth
Hooton, a woman of great age, who had travelled
much in Truth's service, and suffered much for
it, departed this life. She was well the day before
she died, and departed in peace, like a lamb, bearing
testimony to Truth at her departure.</p>

<p>When we had been about seven weeks in Jamaica,
had brought Friends into pretty good order, and settled
several meetings amongst them, we left Solomon
Eccles there; the rest of us embarked for Maryland,
leaving Friends and Truth prosperous in Jamaica,
the Lord's power being over all, and His blessed Seed
reigning.</p>

<p>Before I left Jamaica I wrote another letter to my
wife, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear Heart</span>,
</p>

<p>"To whom is my love, and to the children, in that
which changeth not, but is over all; and to all Friends
in those parts. I have been in Jamaica about five
weeks. Friends here are generally well, and there is
a convincement: but things would be too large to
write of. Sufferings in every place attend me; but
the blessed Seed is over all; the great Lord be
praised, who is Lord of sea and land, and of all things
therein. We intend to pass from hence about the
beginning of next month, towards Maryland, if the
Lord please. Dwell all of you in the Seed of God;
in His Truth I rest in love to you all.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>We went on board on the 8th of First month,<a name="FNanchor_AQ_202" id="FNanchor_AQ_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_202" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a>
1671-2, and, having contrary winds, were a full week
sailing forwards and backwards before we could get
out of sight of Jamaica.</p>

<p>A difficult voyage this proved, and dangerous, especially
in passing through the Gulf of Florida,
where we met with many trials by winds and storms.</p>

<p>But the great God, who is Lord of the sea and
land, and who rideth upon the wings of the wind, did
by His power preserve us through many and great
dangers, when by extreme stress of weather our vessel
was many times likely to be upset, and much of
her tackling broken. And indeed we were sensible
that the Lord was a God at hand, and that His ear
was open to the supplications of His people.</p>

<p>For when the winds were so strong and boisterous,
and the storms and tempests so great that the sailors
knew not what to do, but let the ship go which way
she would, then did we pray unto the Lord, who graciously
heard us, calmed the winds and the seas, gave
us seasonable weather, and made us to rejoice in His
salvation. Blessed and praised be the holy name of
the Lord, whose power hath dominion over all, whom
the winds and the seas obey.</p>

<p>We were between six and seven weeks in this passage
from Jamaica to Maryland. Some days before
we came to land, after we had entered the bay of Patuxent
River, a great storm arose, which cast a boat
upon us for shelter, in which were several people of
account in the world. We took them in; but the boat
was lost, with five hundred pounds' worth of goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
in it, as they said. They continued on board several
days, not having any means to get off; and we had a
very good meeting with them in the ship.</p>

<p>But provisions grew short, for they brought none
in with them; and ours, by reason of the length of our
voyage, were well-nigh spent when they came to us;
so that with their living with us too, we had now little
or none left. Whereupon George Pattison took a
boat, and ventured his life to get to shore; the hazard
was so great that all but Friends concluded he would
be cast away. Yet it pleased the Lord to bring him
safe to land, and in a short time after the Friends
of the place came to fetch us to land also, in a seasonable
time, for our provisions were quite spent.</p>

<p>We partook also of another great deliverance in
this voyage, through the good providence of the
Lord, which we came to understand afterwards. For
when we were determined to come from Jamaica, we
had our choice of two vessels, that were both bound
for the same coast. One of these was a frigate, the
other a yacht. The master of the frigate, we
thought, asked unreasonably for our passage, which
made us agree with the master of the yacht, who offered
to carry us ten shillings a-piece cheaper than
the other.</p>

<p>We went on board the yacht, and the frigate came
out together with us, intending to be consorts during
the voyage. For several days we sailed together;
but, with calms and contrary winds, we were soon
separated. After that the frigate, losing her way,
fell among the Spaniards, by whom she was taken
and plundered, and the master and mate made prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Afterwards, being retaken by the English,
she was sent home to her owners in Virginia. When
we came to understand this we saw and admired the
providence of God, who preserved us out of our enemies'
hands; and he that was covetous fell among
the covetous.</p>

<p>Here we found John Burnyeat,<a name="FNanchor_160_203" id="FNanchor_160_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_203" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> intending shortly
to sail for England; but on our arrival he altered his
purpose, and joined us in the Lord's service. He
had appointed a general meeting for all the Friends
in the province of Maryland, that he might see them
together, and take his leave of them before he departed
out of the country. It was so ordered by the
good providence of God that we landed just in time
to reach that meeting, by which means we had a very
seasonable opportunity of taking the Friends of the
province together.</p>

<p>A very large meeting this was, and it held four
days, to which, besides Friends, came many other
people, several of whom were of considerable quality
in the world's account. There were five or six justices
of the peace, the speaker of their assembly, one
of their council, and others of note, who seemed well
satisfied with the meeting. After the public meetings
were over, the men's and women's meetings began,
wherein I opened to Friends the service thereof,
to their great satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>After this we went to the Cliffs, where another
general meeting was appointed. We went some of
the way by land, the rest by water, and, a storm arising,
our boat was run aground, in danger of being
beaten to pieces, and the water came in upon us. I
was in a great sweat, having come very hot out of a
meeting before, and now was wet with the water besides;
yet, having faith in the divine power, I was
preserved from taking hurt, blessed be the Lord!</p>

<p>To this meeting came many who received the
Truth with reverence. We had also a men's meeting
and a women's meeting. Most of the backsliders
came in again; and several meetings were established
for taking care of the affairs of the Church.</p>

<p>After these two general meetings, we parted company,
dividing ourselves unto several coasts, for the
service of Truth. James Lancaster and John Cartwright
went by sea for New England; William Edmundson
and three Friends more sailed for Virginia,
where things were much out of order; John Burnyeat,
Robert Widders, George Pattison, and I, with
several Friends of the province, went over by boat to
the Eastern Shore,<a name="FNanchor_AR_204" id="FNanchor_AR_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_204" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> and had a meeting there on the
First-day.</p>

<p>There many people received the Truth with gladness,
and Friends were greatly refreshed. A very
large and heavenly meeting it was. Several persons
of quality in that country were at it, two of whom
were justices of the peace. It was upon me from the
Lord to send to the Indian emperor and his kings to
come to that meeting. The emperor came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
was at the meeting. His kings, lying further off,
could not reach the place in time. Yet they came
soon after, with their cockarooses.<a name="FNanchor_161_205" id="FNanchor_161_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_205" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>I had in the evening two good opportunities with
them; they heard the Word of the Lord willingly,
and confessed to it. What I spoke to them I desired
them to speak to their people, and to let them know
that God was raising up His tabernacle of witness in
their wilderness-country, and was setting up His
standard and glorious ensign of righteousness. They
carried themselves very courteously and lovingly,
and inquired where the next meeting would be, saying
that they would come to it. Yet they said they
had had a great debate with their council about their
coming, before they came.</p>

<p>The next day we began our journey by land to
New England; a tedious journey through the woods
and wilderness, over bogs and great rivers.</p>

<p>We took horse at the head of Tredhaven creek,
and travelled through the woods till we came a little
above the head of Miles river, by which we passed,
and rode to the head of Wye river, and so to the
head of Chester river, where, making a fire, we took
up our lodging in the woods. Next morning we travelled
the woods till we came to Sassafras river, which
we went over in canoes, causing our horses to swim
beside us.</p>

<p>Then we rode to Bohemia river, where, in like
manner swimming our horses, we ourselves went over
in canoes. We rested a little at a plantation by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
way, but not long, for we had thirty miles to ride
that afternoon if we would reach a town, which we
were willing to do, and therefore rode hard for it.
I, with some others, whose horses were strong, got
to the town that night, exceedingly tired, and wet to
the skin; but George Pattison and Robert Widders,
being weaker-horsed, were obliged to lie in the woods
that night also.</p>

<p>The town we went to was a Dutch town, called
New Castle,<a name="FNanchor_AS_206" id="FNanchor_AS_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS_206" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a> whither Robert Widders and George
Pattison came to us next morning.</p>

<p>We departed thence, and got over the river Delaware,
not without great danger of some of our lives.
When we were over we were troubled to procure
guides, which were hard to get, and very chargeable.
Then had we that wilderness country, since called
West Jersey, to pass through, not then inhabited by
English; so that we sometimes travelled a whole day
together without seeing man or woman, house or
dwelling-place. Sometimes we lay in the woods by a
fire, and sometimes in the Indians' wigwams or
houses.</p>

<p>We came one night to an Indian town, and lay at
the house of the king, who was a very pretty<a name="FNanchor_AT_207" id="FNanchor_AT_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT_207" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a> man.
Both he and his wife received us very lovingly, and
his attendants (such as they were) were very respectful
to us. They gave us mats to lie on; but provision
was very short with them, they having caught but
little that day. At another Indian town where we
stayed the king came to us, and he could speak some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
English. I spoke to him much, and also to his people;
and they were very loving to us.</p>

<p>At length we came to Middletown, an English
plantation in East Jersey, and there we found some
Friends; but we could not stay to have a meeting at
that time, being earnestly pressed in our spirits to
get to the half-year's meeting of Friends at Oyster
Bay, in Long Island, which was very near at hand.</p>

<p>We went with a Friend, Richard Hartshorn,
brother of Hugh Hartshorn, the upholsterer, in
London, who received us gladly at his house, where
we refreshed ourselves; and then he carried us and
our horses in his own boat over a great water, which
occupied most part of the day getting over, and set
us upon Long Island. We got that evening to Friends
at Gravesend, with whom we tarried that night, and
next day got to Flushing, and the day following
reached Oyster Bay; several Friends of Gravesend
and Flushing accompanied us.</p>

<p>The half-year's meeting began next day, which was
the first day of the week, and lasted four days. The
first and second days we had public meetings for worship,
to which people of all sorts came; on the third
day were the men's and women's meetings, wherein
the affairs of the Church were taken care of. Here
we met with some bad spirits, who had run out from
Truth into prejudice, contention, and opposition to
the order of Truth, and to Friends therein.</p>

<p>These had been very troublesome to Friends in
their meetings there and thereabouts formerly, and
likely would have been so now; but I would not
suffer the service of our men's and women's meetings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
to be interrupted and hindered by their cavils. I let
them know that if they had anything to object
against the order of Truth which we were in, we
would give them a meeting another day on purpose.
And indeed I laboured the more, and travelled the
harder to get to this meeting, where it was expected
many of these contentious people would be; because
I understood they had reflected much upon me, when.
I was far from them.</p>

<p>The men's and women's meetings being over, on
the fourth day we had a meeting with these discontented
people, to which as many of them as chose
came, and as many Friends as desired were present
also; and the Lord's power broke forth gloriously to
the confounding of the gainsayers. Then some of
those that had been chief in the mischievous work of
contention and opposition against the Truth began to
fawn upon me, and to cast the blame upon others;
but the deceitful spirit was judged down and condemned,
and the glorious Truth of God was exalted
and set over all; and they were all brought down and
bowed under. Which was of great service to Truth,
and to the satisfaction and comfort of Friends; glory
to the Lord for ever!</p>

<p>After Friends were gone to their several habitations,
we stayed some days upon the island; had meetings
in several parts thereof, and good service for the
Lord. When we were clear of the island, we returned
to Oyster Bay, waiting for a wind to carry us
to Rhode Island, which was computed to be about
two hundred miles. As soon as the wind served, we
set sail. We arrived there on the thirtieth day of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
Third month, and were gladly received by Friends.
We went to the house of Nicholas Easton, who at
that time was governor of the island; where we
rested, being very weary with travelling.</p>

<p>On First-day following we had a large meeting, to
which came the deputy-governor and several justices,
who were mightily affected with the Truth. The
week following, the Yearly Meeting for all the
Friends of New England and the other colonies adjacent,
was held in this island;<a name="FNanchor_162_208" id="FNanchor_162_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_208" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> to which, besides very
many Friends who lived in those parts, came John
Stubbs from Barbadoes, and James Lancaster and
John Cartwright from another way.</p>

<p>This meeting lasted six days, the first four days
being general public meetings for worship, to which
abundance of other people came. For they having
no priest in the island, and so no restriction to any
particular way of worship; and both the governor and
deputy-governor, with several justices of the peace,
daily frequenting the meetings; this so encouraged
the people that they flocked in from all parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
island. Very good service we had amongst them, and
Truth had good reception.</p>

<p>I have rarely observed a people, in the state
wherein they stood, to hear with more attention,
diligence, and affection, than generally they did, during
the four days; which was also taken notice of by
other Friends.</p>

<p>These public meetings over, the men's meeting
began, which was large, precious, and weighty. The
day following was the women's meeting, which also
was large and very solemn.</p>

<p>These two meetings being for ordering the affairs
of the Church, many weighty things were opened,
and communicated to them, by way of advice, information,
and instruction in the services relating thereunto;
that all might be kept clean, sweet and
savoury amongst them. In these, several men's and
women's meetings for other parts were agreed and
settled, to take care of the poor, and other affairs of
the Church, and to see that all who profess Truth
walk according to the glorious gospel of God.</p>

<p>When this great general meeting was ended, it was
somewhat hard for Friends to part; for the glorious
power of the Lord, which was over all, and His
blessed Truth and life flowing amongst them, had so
knit and united them together, that they spent two
days in taking leave one of another, and of the
Friends of the island; and then, being mightily filled
with the presence and power of the Lord, they went
away with joyful hearts to their several habitations,
in the several colonies where they lived.</p>

<p>When Friends had taken their leave one of another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
we, who travelled amongst them, dispersed
ourselves into our several services, as the Lord
ordered us. John Burnyeat, John Cartwright, and
George Pattison went into the eastern parts of New
England, in company with the Friends that came
from thence, to visit the particular meetings there;
whom John Stubbs and James Lancaster intended to
follow awhile after, in the same service; but they
were not yet clear of this island. Robert Widders
and I stayed longer upon this island; finding service
still here for the Lord, through the great openness
and the daily coming in of fresh people from other
colonies, for some time after the general meeting; so
that we had many large and serviceable meetings
amongst them.</p>

<p>During this time, a marriage was celebrated
amongst Friends in this island, and we were present.
It was at the house of a Friend who had formerly
been governor of the island: and there were present
three justices of the peace, with many others not in
profession with us. Friends said they had never seen
such a solemn assembly on such an occasion, or so
weighty a marriage and so comely an order. Thus
Truth was set over all. This might serve for an example
to others; for there were some present from
many other places.</p>

<p>After this I had a great travail in spirit concerning
the Ranters in those parts, who had been rude at a
meeting at which I was not present. Wherefore I
appointed a meeting amongst them, believing the Lord
would give me power over them; which He did, to
His praise and glory; blessed be His name for ever!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
There were at this meeting many Friends, and divers
other people; some of whom were justices of the
peace, and officers, who were generally well affected
with the Truth. One, who had been a justice twenty
years, was convinced, spoke highly of the Truth, and
more highly of me than is fit for me to mention or
take notice of.</p>

<p>Then we had a meeting at Providence, which was
very large, consisting of many sorts of people. I had
a great travail upon my spirit, that it might be preserved
quiet, and that Truth might be brought over
the people, might gain entrance, and have a place in
them; for they were generally above the priest in
high notions; and some of them came on purpose to
dispute. But the Lord, whom we waited upon, was
with us, and His power went over them all; and His
blessed Seed was exalted and set above all. The disputers
were silent, and the meeting was quiet and
ended well; praised be the Lord! The people went
away mightily satisfied, much desiring another meeting.</p>

<p>This place (called Providence) was about thirty
miles from Rhode Island; and we went to it by water.
The Governor of Rhode Island, and many others,
went with me thither; and we had the meeting in a
great barn, which was thronged with people, so that
I was exceedingly hot, and in a great sweat; but all
was well; the glorious power of the Lord shone over
all; glory to the great God for ever!<a name="FNanchor_163_209" id="FNanchor_163_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_209" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>
<p>After this we went to Narragansett, about twenty
miles from Rhode Island; and the Governor went
with us. We had a meeting at a justice's house,
where Friends had never had any before. It was
very large, for the country generally came in; and
people came also from Connecticut, and other parts
round about, amongst whom were four justices of the
peace. Most of these people had never heard Friends
before; but they were mightily affected with the
meeting, and a great desire there is after the Truth
amongst them; so that our meeting was of very good
service, blessed be the Lord for ever!</p>

<p>The justice at whose house the meeting was, and
another justice of that country, invited me to come
again; but I was then clear of those parts, and going
towards Shelter Island. But John Burnyeat and
John Cartwright, being come out of New England
into Rhode Island, before I was gone, I laid this place
before them; and they felt drawings thither, and
went to visit them.</p>

<p>At another place, I heard some of the magistrates
say among themselves that if they had money
enough, they would hire me to be their minister.
This was where they did not well understand us, and
our principles; but when I heard of it, I said, "It is
time for me to be gone; for if their eye were so much
on me, or on any of us, they would not come to their
own Teacher." For this thing (hiring ministers) had
spoiled many, by hindering them from improving
their own talents; whereas our labour is to bring
every one to his own Teacher <em>in</em> himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>I went thence towards Shelter Island,<a name="FNanchor_164_210" id="FNanchor_164_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_210" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> having
with me Robert Widders, James Lancaster, George
Pattison, and John Jay, a planter of Barbadoes.</p>

<p>We went in a sloop; and passing by Point Juda<a name="FNanchor_AU_211" id="FNanchor_AU_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_211" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a>
and Block Island, we came to Fisher's Island,
where at night we went on shore; but were not able
to stay for the mosquitoes which abound there, and
are very troublesome. Wherefore we went into our
sloop again, put off for the shore, and cast anchor;
and so lay in our sloop that night.</p>

<p>Next day we went into the Sound, but finding our
sloop was not able to live in that water, we returned
again, and came to anchor before Fisher's Island,
where we lay in our sloop that night also. There fell
abundance of rain, and our sloop being open, we were
exceedingly wet.</p>

<p>Next day we passed over the waters called the Two
Horse Races, and then by Gardner's Island; after
which we passed by the Gull's Island, and so got at
length to Shelter Island. Though it was but about
twenty-seven leagues from Rhode Island, yet through
the difficulty of passage we were three days in reaching
it.</p>

<p>The day after, being First-day, we had a meeting
there. In the same week I had another among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
Indians; at which were their king, his council, and
about a hundred Indians more. They sat down like
Friends, and heard very attentively while I spoke to
them by an interpreter, an Indian that could speak
English well. After the meeting they appeared very
loving, and confessed that what was said to them was
Truth.</p>

<p>Next First-day we had a great meeting on the
island, to which came many people who had never
heard Friends before. They were very well satisfied
with it, and when it was over would not go away till
they had spoken with me. Wherefore I went
amongst them, and found they were much taken with
the Truth; good desires were raised in them, and
great love. Blessed be the Lord; His name spreads,
and will be great among the nations, and dreadful
among the heathen.</p>

<p>While we were in Shelter Island, William Edmundson,
who had been labouring in the work of the
Lord in Virginia, came to us. From thence he had
travelled through the desert-country, through difficulties
and many trials, till he came to Roanoke,
where he met with a tender people. After seven
weeks' service in those parts, sailing over to Maryland,
and so to New York, he came to Long Island,
and so to Shelter Island; where we met with him, and
were very glad to hear from him the good service he
had had for the Lord, in the several places where he
had travelled since he parted from us.</p>

<p>We stayed not long in Shelter Island, but entering
our sloop again put to sea for Long Island. We had
a very rough passage, for the tide ran so strong for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
several hours that I have not seen the like; and being
against us, we could hardly get forwards, though we
had a gale.</p>

<p>We were upon the water all that day and the night
following; but found ourselves next day driven back
near to Fisher's Island. For there was a great fog,
and towards day it was very dark, so that we could
not see what way we made. Besides, it rained much
in the night, which in our open sloop made us very
wet.</p>

<p>Next day a great storm arose, so that we were fain
to go over the Sound, and got over with much difficulty.
When we left Fisher's Island, we passed by
Falkner Island, and came to the main, where we cast
anchor till the storm was over.</p>

<p>Then we crossed the Sound, being all very wet;
and much difficulty we had to get to land, the wind
being strong against us. But blessed be the Lord God
of heaven and earth, and of the seas and waters, all
was well.</p>

<p>We got safe to Oyster Bay, in Long Island, which,
they say, is about two hundred miles from Rhode
Island, the seventh of the Sixth month, very early in
the morning.</p>

<p>At Oyster Bay we had a very large meeting. The
same day James Lancaster and Christopher Holder
went over the bay to Rye,<a name="FNanchor_165_212" id="FNanchor_165_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_212" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> on the continent, in Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
Winthrop's government, and had a meeting
there.</p>

<p>From Oyster Bay, we passed about thirty miles to
Flushing, where we had a very large meeting, many
hundreds of people being there; some of whom came
about thirty miles to it. A glorious and heavenly
meeting it was (praised be the Lord God!), and the
people were much satisfied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Christopher Holder and some other
Friends went to a town in Long Island, called
Jamaica, and had a meeting there.</p>

<p>We passed from Flushing to Gravesend, about
twenty miles, and there had three precious meetings;
to which many would have come from New York, but
that the weather hindered them.</p>

<p>Being clear of this place, we hired a sloop, and, the
wind serving, set out for the new country now called
Jersey. Passing down the bay by Coney Island, Natton
Island,<a name="FNanchor_AV_213" id="FNanchor_AV_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_213" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a> and Staten Island, we came to Richard
Hartshorn's at Middletown harbour,<a name="FNanchor_AW_214" id="FNanchor_AW_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_214" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a> about break of
day, the twenty-seventh of the Sixth month.</p>

<p>Next day we rode about thirty miles into that
country, through the woods, and over very bad bogs,
one worse than all the rest; the descent into which
was so steep that we were fain to slide down with our
horses, and then let them lie and breathe themselves
before they could go on. This place the people of
the country called Purgatory.</p>

<p>We got at length to Shrewsbury, in East Jersey,
and on First-day had a precious meeting there, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
which Friends and other people came from afar, and
the blessed presence of the Lord was with us. The
same week we had a men's and women's meeting out
of most parts of New Jersey.</p>

<p>They are building a meeting place in the midst of
them and there is a monthly and general meeting set
up which will be of great service in those parts in
keeping up the gospel order and government of
Christ Jesus, of the increase of which there is no
end, that they who are faithful may see that all who
profess the holy Truth live in the pure religion, and
walk as becometh the gospel.</p>

<p>While we were at Shrewsbury, an accident befel,
which for the time was a great exercise to us. John
Jay, a Friend of Barbadoes, who had come with us
from Rhode Island, and intended to accompany us
through the woods to Maryland, being to try a horse,
got upon his back, and the horse fell a-running, cast
him down upon his head, and broke his neck, as the
people said. Those that were near him took him up
as dead, carried him a good way, and laid him on a
tree.</p>

<p>I got to him as soon as I could; and, feeling him,
concluded he was dead. As I stood pitying him and
his family, I took hold of his hair, and his head
turned any way, his neck was so limber. Whereupon
I took his head in both my hands, and, setting my
knees against the tree, I raised his head, and perceived
there was nothing out or broken that way.</p>

<p>Then I put one hand under his chin, and the other
behind his head, and raised his head two or three
times with all my strength, and brought it in. I soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
perceived his neck began to grow stiff again, and then
he began to rattle in his throat, and quickly after to
breathe.</p>

<p>The people were amazed; but I bade them have a
good heart, be of good faith, and carry him into the
house. They did so, and set him by the fire. I bade
them get him something warm to drink, and put him
to bed. After he had been in the house a while he
began to speak; but did not know where he had been.</p>

<p>The next day we passed away (and he with us,
pretty well) about sixteen miles to a meeting at Middletown,
through woods and bogs, and over a river;
where we swam our horses, and got over ourselves
upon a hollow tree. Many hundred miles did he
travel with us after this.<a name="FNanchor_166_215" id="FNanchor_166_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_215" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>To this meeting came most of the people of the
town. A glorious meeting we had, and the Truth was
over all; blessed be the great Lord God for ever!
After the meeting we went to Middletown Harbor,
about five miles, in order to take our long journey
next morning, through the woods towards Maryland;
having hired Indians for our guides.</p>

<p>I determined to pass through the woods on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
other side of Delaware bay, that we might head the
creeks and rivers as much as possible. On the 9th
of the Seventh month we set forwards, and passed
through many Indian towns, and over some rivers
and bogs; and when we had ridden about forty miles,
we made a fire at night, and lay down by it. As we
came among the Indians, we declared the day of the
Lord to them.</p>

<p>Next day we travelled fifty miles, as we computed;
and at night, finding an old house, which the Indians
had forced the people to leave, we made a fire and
stayed there, at the head of Delaware Bay.<a name="FNanchor_167_216" id="FNanchor_167_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_216" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>
<p>Next day we swam our horses over a river about a
mile wide, first to an island called Upper Tinicum,
and then to the mainland; having hired Indians to
help us over in their canoes. This day we rode but
about thirty miles, and came at night to a Swede's
house, where we got a little straw, and stayed that
night.</p>

<p>Next day, having hired another guide, we travelled
about forty miles through the woods, and made a fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
at night, by which we lay, and dried ourselves; for
we were often wet in our travels.</p>

<p>The next day we passed over a desperate river,<a name="FNanchor_168_217" id="FNanchor_168_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_217" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
which had in it many rocks and broad stones, very
hazardous to us and our horses. Thence we came to
Christiana River, where we swam over our horses,
and went over ourselves in canoes; but the sides of
this river were so bad and miry, that some of the
horses were almost laid up.</p>

<p>Thence we came to New Castle,<a name="FNanchor_AX_218" id="FNanchor_AX_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX_218" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> heretofore
called New Amsterdam; and being very weary,
and inquiring in the town where we might buy
some corn for our horses, the governor came and
invited me to his house, and afterwards desired me
to lodge there; telling me he had a bed for me, and I
should be welcome. So I stayed, the other Friends
being taken care of also.</p>

<p>This was on a Seventh-day; and he offering his
house for a meeting, we had the next day a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
large one; for most of the town were at it. Here had
never been a meeting before, nor any within a great
way; but this was a very precious one. Many were
tender, and confessed to the Truth, and some received
it; blessed be the Lord for ever!</p>

<p>The 16th of the Seventh month we set forward,
and travelled, as near as we could compute, about
fifty miles, through the woods and over the bogs,
heading Bohemia River and Sassafras River. At
night we made a fire in the woods, and lay there all
night. It being rainy weather, we got under some
thick trees for shelter, and afterwards dried ourselves
again by the fire.</p>

<p>Next day we waded through Chester River, a very
broad water, and afterwards passing through many
bad bogs, lay that night also in the woods by a fire,
not having gone above thirty miles that day. The
day following we travelled hard, though we had some
troublesome bogs in our way; we rode about fifty
miles, and got safe that night to Robert Harwood's,
at Miles River,<a name="FNanchor_AY_219" id="FNanchor_AY_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY_219" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a> in Maryland.</p>

<p>This was the 18th of the Seventh month; and
though we were very weary, and much dirtied with
the bogs, yet hearing of a meeting next day, we went
to it, and from it to John Edmundson's. Thence we
went three or four miles by water to a meeting on the
First-day following.</p>

<p>At this meeting a judge's wife, who had never been
at any of our meetings before, was reached. She said
after the meeting that she would rather hear us once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
than the priests a thousand times. Many others also
were well satisfied; for the power of the Lord was
eminently with us. Blessed for ever be His holy
name!</p>

<p>We passed thence about twenty-two miles, and had
a good meeting upon the Kentish shore, to which one
of the judges came. After another good meeting
hard-by, at William Wilcock's, where we had good
service for the Lord, we went by water about twenty
miles to a very large meeting, where were some hundreds
of people, four justices of peace, the high
sheriff of Delaware, and others. There were also an
Indian emperor or governor, and two others of the
chief men among the Indians.</p>

<p>With these Indians I had a good opportunity. I
spoke to them by an interpreter: they heard the
Truth attentively, and were very loving. A blessed
meeting this was, of great service both for convincing
and for establishing in the Truth those that were
convinced of it. Blessed be the Lord, who causeth
His blessed Truth to spread!</p>

<p>After the meeting there came to me a woman
whose husband was one of the judges of that country,
and a member of the assembly there. She told
me that her husband was sick, not likely to live; and
desired me to go home with her to see him. It was
three miles to her house, and I being just come hot
out of the meeting, it was hard for me then to go;
yet considering the service, I got a horse, went with
her, visited her husband, and spoke to him what the
Lord gave me. The man was much refreshed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
finely raised up by the power of the Lord; and afterwards
came to our meetings.</p>

<p>I went back to the Friends that night, and next
day we departed thence about nineteen or twenty
miles to Tredhaven creek, to John Edmundson's
again; whence, the 3d of Eighth month, we went to
the General Meeting for all Maryland Friends.<a name="FNanchor_169_220" id="FNanchor_169_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_220" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>This held five days. The first three meetings were
for public worship, to which people of all sorts came;
the other two were men's and women's meetings. To
the public meetings came many Protestants of divers
sorts, and some Papists. Amongst these were several
magistrates and their wives, and other persons of
chief account in the country. There were so many
besides Friends that it was thought there were sometimes
a thousand people at one of these meetings; so
that, though they had not long before enlarged their
meeting-place, and made it as large again as it was
before, it could not contain the people.</p>

<p>I went by boat every day four or five miles to it,
and there were so many boats at that time passing
upon the river that it was almost like the Thames.
The people said there were never so many boats seen
there together before, and one of the justices said he
had never seen so many people together in that country
before. It was a very heavenly meeting, wherein
the presence of the Lord was gloriously manifested.
Friends were sweetly refreshed, the people generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
satisfied, and many convinced; for the blessed power
of the Lord was over all; everlasting praises to His
holy name for ever!</p>

<p>After the public meetings were over, the men's and
women's meetings began, and were held the other two
days; for I had something to impart to them which
concerned the glory of God, the order of the gospel,
and the government of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>When these meetings were over, we took our leave
of Friends in those parts, whom we left well established
in the Truth.</p>

<p>On the 10th of the Eighth month we went thence
about thirty miles by water, passing by Crane's
Island, Swan Island, and Kent Island, in very foul
weather and much rain. Our boat being open, we
were not only very much wet, but in great danger of
being overset; insomuch that some thought we could
not escape being cast away. But, blessed be God, we
fared very well, and came safely to shore next morning.</p>

<p>Having got to a little house, dried our clothes by
the fire, and refreshed ourselves a little, we took to
our boat again; and put off from land, sometimes sailing
and sometimes rowing; but having very foul
weather that day too, we could not get above twelve
miles forward. At night we got to land, and made a
fire; some lay by that, and some by a fire at a house a
little way off.</p>

<p>Next morning we passed over the Great Bay, and
sailed about forty miles that day. Making to shore at
night, we lay there, some in the boat, and some at an
ale-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning being First-day, we went six or
seven miles to the house of a Friend who was a justice
of the peace, where we had a meeting. This was
a little above the head of the Great Bay. We had
been almost four days on the water, and were weary
with rowing, yet all was very well; blessed and
praised be the Lord!</p>

<p>We went next day to another Friend's house, near
the head of Hatton's Island, where we had good service
amongst Friends and others; as we had also the
day following at the house of George Wilson, a
Friend that lived about three miles further, where we
had a very precious meeting, there being great tenderness
amongst the people.</p>

<p>After this meeting we sailed about ten miles to the
house of James Frizby, a justice of the peace, where,
the 16th of the Eighth month, we had a very large
meeting, at which, besides Friends, were some hundreds
of people, it was supposed. Amongst them
were several justices, captains, and the sheriff, with
other persons of note.</p>

<p>A blessed heavenly meeting this was; a powerful,
thundering testimony for Truth was borne therein;
a great sense there was upon the people, and much
brokenness and tenderness amongst them.</p>

<p>We stayed till about the eleventh hour in the
night, when the tide turned for us; then, taking boat,
we passed that night and the next day about fifty
miles to another Friend's house. The next two days
we made short journeys visiting Friends.</p>

<p>The 20th of the month we had a great meeting at
a place called Severn, where there was a meeting-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
but not large enough to hold the people.
Divers chief magistrates were at it, with many other
considerable people, and it gave them generally great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Two days after we had a meeting with some that
walked disorderly, and had good service in it. Then,
spending a day or two in visiting Friends, we passed
to the Western Shore, and on the 25th had a large
and precious meeting at William Coale's, where the
speaker of their assembly, with his wife, a justice of
peace, and several people of quality, were present.</p>

<p>Next day we had a meeting, six or seven miles further,
at Abraham Birkhead's, where were many of
the magistrates and upper sort; and the speaker of
the assembly for that country was convinced. A
blessed meeting it was; praised be the Lord!</p>

<p>We travelled the next day; and the day following,
the 28th of the Eighth month, had a large and very
precious meeting at Peter Sharp's, on the Cliffs,
between thirty and forty miles distant from the
former. Many of the magistrates and upper rank of
people were present, and a heavenly meeting it was.
The wife of one of the Governor's council was convinced;
and her husband was very loving to Friends.
A justice of the peace from Virginia was convinced,
and hath had a meeting since at his house.</p>

<p>Some Papists were at this meeting, one of whom,
before he came, threatened to dispute with me; but
he was reached and could not oppose. Blessed be the
Lord, the Truth reached into the hearts of people beyond
words, and it is of a good savour amongst them!</p>

<p>After the meeting we went about eighteen miles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
the house of James Preston, a Friend that lived on
Patuxent River. Thither came to us an Indian king,
with his brother, to whom I spoke, and found they
understood what I spoke of.</p>

<p>Having finished our service in Maryland, and intending
to go to Virginia, we had a meeting at Patuxent
on the 4th of the Ninth month, to take our leave
of Friends. Many people of all sorts were at it, and a
powerful meeting it was.</p>

<p>On the 5th we set sail for Virginia, and in three
days came to a place called Nancemond, about two
hundred miles from Maryland. In this voyage we
met with foul weather, storms, and rain, and lay in
the woods by a fire in the night.</p>

<p>At Nancemond lived a Friend called the widow
Wright. Next day we had a great meeting there, of
Friends and others. There came to it Colonel Dewes,
with several other officers and magistrates, who were
much taken with the Truth declared.</p>

<p>After this, we hastened towards Carolina; yet had
several meetings by the way, wherein we had good
service for the Lord; one about four miles from
Nancemond Water, which was very precious; and
there was a men's and women's meeting settled, for
taking care of the affairs of the Church.</p>

<p>Another very good one also we had at William
Yarrow's, at Pagan Creek, which was so large, that
we were fain to be abroad, the house not being large
enough to contain the people. A great openness there
was; the sound of Truth spread abroad, and had a
good savour in the hearts of people; the Lord have
the glory for ever!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>After this our way to Carolina grew worse, being
much of it plashy, and pretty full of great bogs and
swamps; so that we were commonly wet to the knees,
and lay abroad at nights in the woods by a fire.</p>

<p>One night we got to a poor house at Sommertown,<a name="FNanchor_AZ_221" id="FNanchor_AZ_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ_221" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a>
and lay by the fire. The woman of the
house had a sense of God upon her. The report
of our travel had reached thither, and drawn some
that lived beyond Sommertown to that house, in expectation
to see and hear us (so acceptable was the
sound of Truth in that wilderness country); but they
missed us.</p>

<p>The next day, the 21st of the Ninth month, having
travelled hard through the woods and over many bogs
and swamps, we reached Bonner's Creek; and there
we lay that night by the fireside, the woman lending
us a mat to lie on.</p>

<p>This was the first house we came to in Carolina.
Here we left our horses, over-wearied with travel.
Thence we went down the creek in a canoe, to Macocomocock
River,<a name="FNanchor_BA_222" id="FNanchor_BA_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA_222" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a> and came to Hugh Smith's
house, where the people of other professions
came to see us (for there were no Friends in that part
of the country), and many of them received us gladly.</p>

<p>Amongst others came Nathaniel Batts, who had
been Governor of Roanoke; he went by the name of
Captain Batts, and had been a rude, desperate man.
He asked me about a woman in Cumberland, who, he
said he had been told, had been healed by our prayers,
and by laying on of hands, after she had been long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
sick, and given over by the physicians; and he desired
to know the certainty of it. I told him we did not
glory in such things, but many such things had been
done by the power of Christ.</p>

<p>Not far from here we had a meeting among the
people, and they were taken with the Truth; blessed
be the Lord! Then passing down the river Maratick<a name="FNanchor_BB_223" id="FNanchor_BB_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_223" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a>
in a canoe, we went down the bay Coney-Hoe, and
came to the house of a captain, who was very loving,
and lent us his boat, for we were much wet in the
canoe, the water splashing in upon us. With this
boat we went to the Governor's house; but the water
in some places was so shallow that the boat, being
laden, could not swim; so we were fain to put off our
shoes and stockings, and wade through the water
some distance.</p>

<p>The Governor, with his wife, received us lovingly;
but a doctor there would needs dispute with us. And
truly his opposing us was of good service, giving occasion
for the opening of many things to the people concerning
the Light and Spirit of God, which he denied
to be in everyone; and affirmed that it was not in the
Indians.</p>

<p>Whereupon I called an Indian to us, and asked him
whether when he lied, or did wrong to any one, there
was not something in him that reproved him for it.
He said there was such a thing in him, that did so
reprove him; and he was ashamed when he had done
wrong, or spoken wrong. So we shamed the doctor
before the Governor and the people; insomuch that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
the poor man ran out so far that at length he would
not own the Scriptures.</p>

<p>We tarried at the Governor's that night; and next
morning he very courteously walked with us himself
about two miles through the woods, to a place
whither he had sent our boat about to meet us. Taking
leave of him, we entered our boat, and went that
day about thirty miles to the house of Joseph Scott,
one of the representatives of the country.</p>

<p>There we had a sound, precious meeting; the people
were tender, and much desired after meetings. At
a house about four miles further, we had another
meeting, to which came the Governor's secretary,
who was chief secretary of the province, and had
been formerly convinced.</p>

<p>Having visited the north part of Carolina, and
made a little entrance for Truth upon the people
there, we began to return towards Virginia, having
several meetings in our way, wherein we had very
good service for the Lord, the people being generally
tender and open; blessed be the Lord!</p>

<p>We lay one night at the house of the secretary, to
get to which gave us much trouble; for the water
being shallow, we could not bring our boat to shore;
but the secretary's wife, seeing our strait, came herself
in a canoe (her husband being from home) and
brought us to land.</p>

<p>Next morning our boat was sunk; but we got her
up, mended her, and went away in her that day about
twenty-four miles, the water being rough, and the
winds high; but the great power of God was seen, in
carrying us safe in that rotten boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon our return we had a very precious meeting
at Hugh Smith's; praised be the Lord for ever! The
people were very tender, and very good service we
had amongst them. There was at this meeting an
Indian captain, who was very loving; and acknowledged
it to be Truth that was spoken. There was also
one of the Indian priests, whom they called a Pawaw,
who sat soberly among the people.</p>

<p>The 9th of the Tenth month we got back to Bonner's
Creek, where we had left our horses, having
spent about eighteen days in the north of Carolina.</p>

<p>Our horses having rested, we set forward for Virginia
again, travelling through the woods and bogs as
far as we could well reach that day, and at night lying
by a fire in the woods. Next day we had a tedious
journey through bogs and swamps, and were exceedingly
wet and dirty all the day, but dried ourselves at
night by a fire.</p>

<p>We got that night to Sommertown. As we came
near, the woman of the house, seeing us, spoke to her
son to keep up their dogs; for both in Virginia and
Carolina (living lonely in the woods) they generally
keep great dogs to guard their houses. But the son
said, "There is no need; our dogs will not meddle
with these people." When we were come into the
house, she told us we were like the children of Israel,
against whom the dogs did not move their tongues.
Here we lay in our clothes by the fire, as we had done
many a night before.</p>

<p>Next day we had a meeting; for the people, having
been informed of us, had a great desire to hear us;
and a very good meeting we had among them, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
we never had had one before; praised be the Lord for
ever! After the meeting we hastened away.</p>

<p>When we had ridden about twenty miles, calling at
a house to inquire the way, the people desired us to
tarry all night with them; which we did.</p>

<p>Next day we came among Friends, after we had
travelled about an hundred miles from Carolina into
Virginia: in which time we observed great variety of
climates, having passed in a few days from a very
cold to a warm and spring-like country. But the
power of the Lord is the same in all, is over all, and
doth reach the good in all; praised be the Lord for
ever!</p>

<p>We spent about three weeks in travelling through
Virginia, mostly amongst Friends, having large and
precious meetings in several parts of the country; as
at the widow Wright's, where many of the magistrates,
officers, and other high people came. A most
heavenly meeting we had; wherein the power of the
Lord was so great that it struck a dread upon the
assembly, chained all down, and brought reverence
upon the people's minds.</p>

<p>Among the officers was a major, kinsman to the
priest, who told me that the priest had threatened to
come and oppose us. But the Lord's power was too
strong for him, and stopped him; and we were quiet
and peaceable. The people were wonderfully affected
with the testimony of Truth; blessed be the Lord for
ever!</p>

<p>Having finished what service lay upon us in Virginia,
on the 30th we set sail in an open sloop for
Maryland. But having a great storm, and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
much wet, we were glad to get to shore before night;
and, walking to a house at Willoughby Point, we got
lodging there that night. The woman of the house
was a widow, and a very tender person; she had
never received Friends before; but she received us
very kindly, and with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>We returned to our boat in the morning, and
hoisted our sail, getting forward as fast as we could.
But towards evening, a storm rising, we had much
ado to get to shore; and our boat being open, the
water splashed often in, and sometimes over us, so
that we were completely wet. Being got to land, we
made a fire in the woods to warm and dry us, and
there we lay all night, the wolves howling about us.</p>

<p>On the 1st of the Eleventh month we sailed again.
The wind being against us, we made but little headway,
and were fain to get to shore at Point Comfort,
where yet we found but small comfort. For the
weather was so cold that though we made a good fire
in the woods to lie by, the water that we had brought
for our use was frozen near the fireside. We made
to sea again next day; but the wind being strong and
against us, we advanced but little. We were glad to
get to land again, and travelled about to find some
house where we might buy provisions, for our store
was spent.</p>

<p>That night, also, we lay in the woods; and so
extremely cold was the weather, the wind blowing
high, and the frost and snow being great, that it was
hard for some of us to abide it.</p>

<p>On the 3d, the wind setting pretty fair, we fetched
it up by sailing and rowing, and got that night to Milford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
Haven, where we lay at Richard Long's, near
Quince's Island.</p>

<p>Next day we passed by Rappahannock River,
where dwell many people; and Friends had a meeting
there at the house of a justice, who had formerly
been at a meeting where I was.</p>

<p>We passed over Potomac River also, the winds
being high, the water very rough, our sloop open,
and the weather extremely cold; and had a meeting
there also, where some people were convinced.
When we parted thence, some of our company went
amongst them. We next steered our course for
Patuxent River. I sat at the helm the greater part
of the day, and some of the night. About the first
hour in the morning we reached James Preston's
house, on Patuxent River, which is about two hundred
miles from Nancemond in Virginia.</p>

<p>We were very weary; yet the next day being the
first of the week, we went to the meeting not far
from there. The same week we went to an Indian
king's cabin, where were several of the Indians, with
whom we had a good opportunity to discourse; and
they carried themselves very lovingly. We went
also that week to a general meeting; then about
eighteen miles further to John Geary's, where we
had a very precious meeting; praised be the Lord
God for ever!</p>

<p>After this the cold grew so exceedingly sharp, the
frost and snow so extreme, beyond what was usual in
that country, that we could hardly endure it.
Neither was it easy or safe to stir out; yet we got,
with some difficulty, six miles through the snow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
John Mayor's, where we met with some Friends
come from New England, whom we had left there
when we came away; and glad we were to see each
other, after so long and tedious travels.</p>

<p>By these Friends we understood that William
Edmundson, having been at Rhode Island and New
England, was gone thence for Ireland; that Solomon
Eccles, coming from Jamaica and landing at Boston
in New England, was taken at a meeting there, and
banished to Barbadoes; that John Stubbs and another
Friend were gone into New Jersey, and several
other Friends to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the Leeward
Islands. It was matter of joy to us to understand
that the work of the Lord went on and prospered,
and that Friends were unwearied and diligent
in the service.</p>

<p>The 27th of the Eleventh month we had a very
precious meeting in a tobacco-house. The next day
we returned to James Preston's, about eighteen
miles distant. When we came there, we found his
house had been burnt to the ground the night before,
through the carelessness of a maid-servant; so we
lay three nights on the ground by the fire, the
weather being very cold.</p>

<p>We made an observation which was somewhat
strange, but certainly true; that one day, in the
midst of this cold weather, the wind turning into the
south, it grew so hot that we could hardly bear the
heat; and the next day and night, the wind chopping
back into the north, we could hardly endure the
cold.</p>

<p>Having travelled through most parts of that country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
and visited most of the plantations, and having
sounded the alarm to all people where we came, and
proclaimed the day of God's salvation amongst them,
we found our spirits began to be clear of these parts
of the world, and draw towards Old England again.
Yet we were desirous, and felt freedom from the
Lord, to stay over the general meeting for the province
of Maryland, which drew nigh; that we might
see Friends generally together before we departed.</p>

<p>Spending our time in the interim in visiting
Friends and Friendly people, in attending meetings
about the Cliffs and Patuxent, and in writing
answers to cavilling objections which some of Truth's
adversaries had raised and spread abroad to hinder
people from receiving the Truth, we were not idle,
but laboured in the work of the Lord until that general
provincial meeting came on, which began on the
17th of the Third month, and lasted four days. On
the first of these the men and women had their meetings
for business, wherein the affairs of the Church
were taken care of, and many things relating thereto
were opened unto them, to their edification and comfort.</p>

<p>The other three days were spent in public meetings
for the worship of God, at which divers of considerable
account in the government, and many others,
were present. These were generally satisfied, and
many of them reached; for it was a wonderful, glorious
meeting, and the mighty presence of the Lord
was seen and felt over all; blessed and praised for
ever be His holy name, who over all giveth dominion!</p>

<p>After this meeting we took our leave of Friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
parting in great tenderness, in the sense of the heavenly
life and virtuous power of the Lord that was
livingly felt amongst us; and went by water to the
place where we were to take shipping, many Friends
accompanying us thither and tarrying with us that
night.</p>

<p>Next day, the 21st of the Third month, 1673, we
set sail for England; the same day Richard Covell
came on board our ship, having had his own taken
from him by the Dutch.</p>

<p>We had foul weather and contrary winds, which
caused us to cast anchor often, so that we were till
the 31st ere we could get past the capes of Virginia
and out into the main sea. But after this we made
good speed, and on the 28th of the Fourth month cast
anchor at King's Road, which is the harbour for Bristol.</p>

<p>We had on our passage very high winds and tempestuous
weather, which made the sea exceedingly
rough, the waves rising like mountains; so that the
masters and sailors wondered at it, and said they had
never seen the like before. But though the wind
was strong it set for the most part with us, so that
we sailed before it; and the great God who commands
the winds, who is Lord of heaven, of earth, and the
seas, and whose wonders are seen in the deep, steered
our course and preserved us from many imminent
dangers. The same good hand of Providence that
went with us, and carried us safely over, watched
over us in our return, and brought us safely back
again; thanksgiving and praises be to his holy name
for ever!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>Many sweet and precious meetings we had on
board the ship during this voyage (commonly two a
week), wherein the blessed presence of the Lord did
greatly refresh us, and often break in upon and tender
the company.</p>

<p>When we came into Bristol harbour, there lay
a man-of-war, and the press-master came on board
to impress our men. We had a meeting at that time
in the ship with the seamen, before we went to shore;
and the press-master sat down with us, stayed the
meeting, and was well satisfied with it. After the
meeting I spoke to him to leave in our ship two of
the men he had impressed, for he had impressed four,
one of whom was a lame man. He said, "At your
request I will."</p>

<p>We went on shore that afternoon, and got to
Shirehampton. We procured horses and rode to Bristol
that night, where Friends received us with great
joy. In the evening I wrote a letter to my wife, to
give her notice of my landing.<a name="FNanchor_170_224" id="FNanchor_170_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_224" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p class="center oldenglish">The Last Imprisonment.</p>

<h3>1673-1678.</h3>


<p>Between this and the fair, my wife came out of the
North to Bristol to me, and her son-in-law, Thomas
Lower, with two of her daughters,<a name="FNanchor_171_225" id="FNanchor_171_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_225" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> came with her.
Her other son-in-law, John Rous, William Penn and
his wife, and Gerrard Roberts, came from London,
and many Friends from several parts of the nation,
to the fair; and glorious, powerful meetings we had
at that time, for the Lord's infinite power and life
was over all.</p>

<p>I passed into Wiltshire, where also we had many
blessed meetings. At Slattenford, in Wiltshire, we
had a very good meeting, though we met there with
much opposition from some who had set themselves
against women's meetings; which I was moved of the
Lord to recommend to Friends, for the benefit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
advantage of the Church of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_172_226" id="FNanchor_172_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_226" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> "that faithful
women, who were called to the belief of the Truth,
being made partakers of the same precious faith, and
heirs of the same everlasting gospel of life and salvation
with the men, might in like manner come into
the possession and practice of the gospel order, and
therein be helpmeets unto the men in the restoration,<a name="FNanchor_BC_227" id="FNanchor_BC_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC_227" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a>
in the service of Truth, in the affairs of the
Church, as they are outwardly in civil, or temporal
things; that so all the family of God, women as well
as men, might know, possess, perform, and discharge
their offices and services in the house of God, whereby
the poor might be better taken care of, the
younger instructed, informed, and taught in the way
of God; the loose and disorderly reproved and admonished
in the fear of the Lord; the clearness of
persons proposing marriage more closely and strictly
inquired into in the wisdom of God; and all the members
of the spiritual body, the Church, might watch
over and be helpful to each other in love."</p>

<p>After a visit at Kingston, I went to London, where
I found the Baptists and Socinians, with some old
apostates, grown very rude, having printed many
books against us; so that I had a great travail in the
Lord's power, before I could get clear of that city.
But blessed be the Lord, his power came over them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
and all their lying, wicked, scandalous books were answered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[After a visit with William Penn at the latter's
home at Rickmansworth, he started on his journey
north towards Swarthmore, accompanied by his wife,
two of her daughters and his son-in-law, Thomas
Lower, a journey which led to more than a year's imprisonment&mdash;his
last imprisonment, as it proved.]</p></blockquote>

<p>At night, as I was sitting at supper, I felt I was
taken; yet I said nothing then to any one of it. But
getting out next morning, we travelled into Worcestershire,
and went to John Halford's, at Armscott,
where we had a very large and precious meeting in
his barn, the Lord's powerful presence being eminently
with and amongst us.</p>

<p>After the meeting, Friends being most of them
gone, as I was sitting in the parlour, discoursing with
some Friends, Henry Parker, a justice, came to the
house, and with him one Rowland Hains, a priest of
Hunniton, in Warwickshire. This justice heard of
the meeting by means of a woman Friend, who, being
nurse to a child of his, asked leave of her mistress
to go to the meeting to see me; and she speaking of
it to her husband, he and the priest plotted together
to come and break it up and apprehend me.</p>

<p>But from their sitting long at dinner, it being the
day on which his child was sprinkled, they did not
come till the meeting was over, and Friends mostly
gone. But though there was no meeting when they
came, yet I, who was the person they aimed at, being
in the house, Henry Parker took me, and Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
Lower for company with me; and though he had
nothing to lay to our charge, sent us both to Worcester
jail, by a strange sort of mittimus.</p>

<p>Being thus made prisoners, without any probable
appearance of being released before the quarter-sessions
at soonest, we got some Friends to accompany
my wife and her daughter into the north, and we
were conveyed to Worcester. Thence, by the time
I thought my wife would reach home, I wrote her the
following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Heart</span>:</p>

<p>"Thou seemedst to be a little grieved when I was
speaking of prisons, and when I was taken. Be content
with the will of the Lord God. For when I was
at John Rous's, at Kingston, I had a sight of my
being taken prisoner; and when I was at Bray
Doily's, in Oxfordshire, as I sat at supper, I saw I
was taken, and I saw I had a suffering to undergo.
But the Lord's power is over all; blessed be His holy
name forever!</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>[This imprisonment began December 17th, 1673.
The case was brought before the sessions on the 21st of
January, 1674. "When we came in," he writes, "they
were stricken with paleness in their faces, and it was
some time before anything was spoken; insomuch that
a butcher in the hall said, 'What, are they afraid?
Dare not the justices speak to them?'" There was
manifestly no case against them on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mittimus</i>, but
the judge, at the suggestion of the "priest," took the
easy way to catch them. "You, Mr. Fox, are a famous
man, and all this may be true which you have said;
but, that we may be the better satisfied, will you take
the oaths of allegiance and supremacy?" The usual
refusal was given, followed with the penalty of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmunire</i>.
During this long imprisonment he had the
promise of a pardon from the king, but he refused to
get his liberty by any method which implied that he
had done wrong and needed pardon. At the next sessions,
in April, he got a temporary liberty, so that he
went to London and attended yearly meeting, after
which he returned to Worcester for a new trial,
which ended in the same old way. Meantime the
strong man's constitution was yielding to the incessant
strain upon it.]</p></blockquote>

<p>About this time I had a fit of sickness, which
brought me very low and weak in my body; and I
continued so a pretty while, insomuch that some
Friends began to doubt of my recovery. I seemed
to myself to be amongst the graves and dead corpses;
yet the invisible power did secretly support me, and
conveyed refreshing strength into me, even when I
was so weak that I was almost speechless. One
night, as I was lying awake upon my bed in the glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
of the Lord which was over all, it was said unto me
that the Lord had a great deal more work for me to
do for Him before He took me to Himself.</p>

<p>After this [about October 1st, 1674] my wife
went to London, and spoke to the King, laying before
him my long and unjust imprisonment, with the
manner of my being taken, and the justices' proceedings
against me, in tendering me the oath as a snare,
whereby they had præmunired me; so that I being
now his prisoner, it was in his power, and at his pleasure,
to release me, which she desired.</p>

<p>The King spoke kindly to her, and referred her to
the Lord-Keeper; to whom she went; but she could
not obtain what she desired, for he said the King
could not release me otherwise than by a pardon, and
I was not free to receive a pardon, knowing I had
not done evil. If I would have been freed by a pardon,
I need not have lain so long, for the King was
willing to give me pardon long before, and told
Thomas Moore that I need not scruple, being released
by a pardon, for many a man that was as innocent
as a child had had a pardon granted him; yet I
could not consent to have one. For I would rather
have lain in prison all my days, than have come out
in any way dishonourable to Truth; therefore I chose
to have the validity of my indictment tried before the
judges.</p>

<p>Thereupon, having first had the opinion of a counsellor
upon it (Thomas Corbet, of London, with
whom Richard Davis, of Welchpool, was well acquainted,
and whom he recommended to me), an
habeas corpus was sent down to Worcester to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
me up once more to the King's Bench bar, for the
trial of the errors in my indictment. The under-sheriff
set forward with me the 4th of the Twelfth
month.</p>

<p>We came to London on the 8th, and on the 11th I
was brought before the four judges at the King's
Bench, where Counsellor Corbet pleaded my cause.
He started a new plea; for he told the judges that
they could not imprison any man upon a præmunire.</p>

<p>Chief-Justice Hale said, "Mr. Corbet, you should
have come sooner, at the beginning of the term, with
this plea."</p>

<p>He answered, "We could not get a copy of the return
and the indictment."</p>

<p>The Judge replied, "You should have told us, and
we would have forced them to make a return sooner."</p>

<p>Then said Judge Wild, "Mr. Corbet, you go upon
general terms; and if it be as you say, we have committed
many errors at the Old Bailey, and in other
courts."</p>

<p>Corbet was positive that by law they could not imprison
upon a præmunire.</p>

<p>The Judge said, "There is summons in the
statute."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Corbet, "but summons is not imprisonment;
for summons is in order to a trial."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Judge, "we must have time to
look in our books and consult the statutes." So the
hearing was put off till the next day.</p>

<p>The next day they chose rather to let this plea fall
and begin with the errors of the indictment; and
when they came to be opened, they were so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
and gross that the judges were all of opinion that the
indictment was quashed and void, and that I ought
to have my liberty.</p>

<p>There were that day several great men, lords and
others, who had the oaths of allegiance and supremacy
tendered to them in open court, just before my
trial came on; and some of my adversaries moved the
judges that the oaths might be tendered again to me,
telling them I was a dangerous man to be at liberty.</p>

<p>But Chief-Justice Hale<a name="FNanchor_174_229" id="FNanchor_174_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_229" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> said that he had indeed
heard some such reports, but he had also heard many
more good reports of me; and so he and the rest of
the judges ordered me to be freed by proclamation.</p>

<p>Thus after I had suffered imprisonment a year and
almost two months for nothing, I was fairly set at
liberty upon a trial of the errors in my indictment,
without receiving any pardon, or coming under any
obligation or engagement at all; and the Lord's everlasting
power went over all, to His glory and praise.</p>

<p>Counsellor Corbet, who pleaded for me, obtained
great fame by it, for many of the lawyers came to
him and told him he had brought that to light which
had not been known before, as to the not imprisoning
upon a præmunire; and after the trial a judge said to
him, "You have attained a great deal of honour by
pleading George Fox's cause so in court."<a name="FNanchor_175_230" id="FNanchor_175_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_230" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Being at liberty, I visited Friends in London; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
having been very weak, and not yet well recovered,
I went to Kingston; and having visited Friends there,
returned to London, wrote a paper to the Parliament,
and sent several books to them.</p>

<p>A great book against swearing had been delivered
to them a little before; the reasonableness whereof
had so much influence, that it was thought they
would have done something towards our relief if they
had sat longer. I stayed in and near London till the
yearly meeting, to which Friends came from most
parts of the nation, and some from beyond sea. A
glorious meeting we had in the everlasting power of
God.</p>

<p>The illness I got in my imprisonment at Worcester
had so much weakened me that it was long before I
recovered my natural strength again. For which
reason, and as many things lay upon me to write,
both for public and private service, I did not stir
much abroad during the time that I now stayed in
the north; but when Friends were not with me, I
spent much time in writing for Truth's service.
While I was at Swarthmore, I gave several books to
be printed.<a name="FNanchor_176_231" id="FNanchor_176_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_231" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

God.</p>

<p>"In the power of the Lord I am brought to York,
having had many meetings in the way. The road

sometimes were down, and we were not able to ride;
and sometimes we had great storms and rain; but by
the power of the Lord I went through all.</p>

<p>[After much service in several counties, he returns
to London. The Journal proceeds:]</p></blockquote>

<p>It pleased the Lord to bring me safe to London,
though much wearied; for though I rode not very far
in a day, yet, through weakness of body, continual
travelling was hard to me. Besides, I had not much
rest at night to refresh nature; for I often sat up late
with Friends, where I lodged, to inform and advise
them in things wherein they were wanting; and when
in bed I was often hindered of sleep by great pains in
my head and teeth, occasioned, as I thought, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
cold taken by riding often in the rain. But the
Lord's power was over all, and carried me through
all, to His praise.</p>

<p>To the London Yearly Meeting<a name="FNanchor_BD_232" id="FNanchor_BD_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD_232" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a> many Friends
came from most parts of the nation; and some out of
Scotland, Holland, etc. Very glorious meetings we
had, wherein the Lord's powerful presence was very
largely felt; and the affairs of Truth were sweetly
carried on in the unity of the Spirit, to the satisfaction
and comfort of the upright-hearted; blessed be
the Lord for ever!</p>

<p>After the yearly meeting, having stayed a week
or two with Friends in London, I went down with
William Penn to his house in Sussex,<a name="FNanchor_BE_233" id="FNanchor_BE_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE_233" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a> John
Burnyeat and some other Friends being with
us. As we passed through Surrey, hearing the
quarterly meeting was that day, William Penn,
John Burnyeat, and I, went from the road to it; and
after the meeting returning to our other company,
went with them to William Penn's that night; which
is forty miles from London.</p>

<p>I stayed at Worminghurst about three weeks; in
which time John Burnyeat and I answered a very
envious and wicked book, which Roger Williams, a
priest of New England (or some colony thereabouts)
had written against Truth and Friends.<a name="FNanchor_177_234" id="FNanchor_177_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_234" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>
<p>When we had finished that service, we went with
Stephen Smith to his house at Warpledon in Surrey,
where we had a large meeting. Friends thereaway
had been exceedingly plundered about two months
before on the priest's account; for they took from
Stephen Smith five kine (being all he had) for about
fifty shillings tithes.</p>

<p>Thence we went to Kingston, and so to London,
where I stayed not long; for it was upon me from the
Lord to go into Holland, to visit Friends and to
preach the gospel there, and in some parts of Germany.
Wherefore, setting things in order for my
journey as fast as I could, I took leave of Friends at
London; and with several other Friends went down
to Colchester, in order to my passage for Holland.</p>

<p>Next day, being First-day, I was at the public
meeting of Friends there, which was very large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
peaceable. In the evening I had another large one,
but not so public, at John Furly's house, where I
lodged. The day following I was at the women's
meeting there, which also was very large.</p>

<p>Thence next day we passed to Harwich, where
Robert Duncan, and several other Friends out of the
country, came to see us; and some from London came
to us there, that intended to go over with me.</p>

<p>The packet in which we were to go not being ready,
we went to the meeting in the town, and a precious
opportunity we had together; for the Lord, according
to His wonted goodness, by His overcoming, refreshing
power, opened many mouths to declare His everlasting
Truth, to praise and glorify Him.</p>

<p>After the meeting at Harwich we returned to John
Vandewall's, where I had lodged; and when the boat
was ready, taking leave of Friends, we that were
bound for Holland went on board about nine in the
evening, on the 25th of the Fifth month, 1677. The
Friends that went over with me, were William Penn,
Robert Barclay, George Keith and his wife, John
Furly and his brother, William Tallcoat, George
Watts, and Isabel Yeomans, one of my wife's daughters.</p>

<p>About one in the morning we weighed anchor,
having a fair brisk wind, which by next morning
brought us within sight of Holland. But that day
proving very clear and calm we got forward little,
till about four in the afternoon, when a fresh gale
arose which carried us within a league of land. Then
being becalmed again, we cast anchor for that night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
it being between the hours of nine and ten in the
evening.</p>

<p>William Penn and Robert Barclay, understanding
that Benjamin Furly was come from Rotterdam to
the Briel to meet us, got two of the boatmen to let
down a small boat that belonged to the packet, and
row them to shore; but before they could reach it the
gates were shut; and there being no house without
the gates, they lay in a fisherman's boat all night.</p>

<p>As soon as the gates were opened in the morning,
they went in, and found Benjamin Furly, with other
Friends of Rotterdam, that were come thither to receive
us; and they sent a boat, with three young men
in it, that lived with Benjamin Furly, who brought
us to the Briel, where the Friends received us with
great gladness.</p>

<p>We stayed about two hours to refresh ourselves,
and then took boat, with the Holland Friends, for
Rotterdam, where we arrived about eleven that day,
the 28th of the month. I was very well this voyage,
but some of the Friends were sea-sick. A fine
passage we had, and all came safe and well to land;
blessed and praised be the name of the Lord for ever!</p>

<p>Next day, being First-day, we had two meetings at
Benjamin Furly's, where many of the townspeople
and some officers came in, and all were civil. Benjamin
Furly, or John Claus, a Friend of Amsterdam,
interpreted, when any Friend declared. I spent the
next day in visiting Friends there.</p>

<p>The day following, William Penn and I, with other
Friends, went towards Amsterdam with some Friends
of that city, who came to Rotterdam to conduct us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
thither. We took boat in the afternoon, and, passing
by Overkirk, came to Delft, through which we
walked on foot.</p>

<p>We then took boat again to Leyden, where we
lodged that night at an inn. This is six Dutch miles
from Rotterdam, which are eighteen English miles,
and five hours' sail or travelling; for our boat was
drawn by a horse that went on the shore.</p>

<p>Next day, taking boat again, we went to Haarlem,
fourteen miles from Leyden, where we had appointed
a meeting, which proved very large; for
many of the townspeople came in, and two of their
preachers. The Lord gave us a blessed opportunity,
not only with respect to Friends, but to other sober
people, and the meeting ended peaceably and well.
After it we passed to Amsterdam.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[After a conference, the following meetings were established
or "settled."]</p></blockquote>

<p>A monthly, a quarterly, and a yearly meeting, to be
held at Amsterdam for Friends in all the United
Provinces of Holland, and in Embden, the Palatinate,
Hamburg, Frederickstadt, Dantzic, and other places
in and about Germany; which Friends were glad of,
and it has been of great service to Truth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[One of the most interesting episodes of this journey
was the visit paid by George Keith's wife and Fox's
step-daughter, Isabel Yeomans, to the Princess Elizabeth,
to whom Fox sent a personal letter. "Princess
Elizabeth" was the daughter of the unfortunate Frederick,
Elector Palatine, and granddaughter of James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
the first of England. She was a woman of great spiritual
gifts and of considerable intellectual power. She
was the friend and correspondent of the philosopher
Des Cartes. She had, previous to this visit, made the
acquaintance (which developed into close friendship)
of William Penn and Robert Barclay. She frequently
used her influence upon her uncle, King Charles, and
her brother, Prince Rupert, to secure the release of
Friends from the prisons of England and Scotland.
Her answer to George Fox's letter is as follows:]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:</p>

<p>"I cannot but have a tender love to those that love
the Lord Jesus Christ, and to whom it is given, not
only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him;
therefore your letter and your Friends' visit have
been both very welcome to me. I shall follow their
and your counsel as far as God will afford me light
and unction; remaining still your loving friend,</p>

their stage. In the great struggle with Louis XIV.

<p>One of the magistrates of that city [Groningen]
came with us from Leeuwarden, with whom I had
some discourse on the way, and he was very loving.
We walked nearly two miles through the city, and
then took boat for Delfziel; and passing in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
through a town called Appingdalem, where had
been a great horse-fair that day, there came many
officers rushing into the boat, and being somewhat in
drink, they were very rude. I spoke to them, exhorting
them to fear the Lord, and beware of Solomon's
vanities. They were boisterous fellows; yet somewhat
more civil afterwards.</p>

<p>[The other circumstance which connects Fox here
with history is his epistle written to the Peace Ambassadors

dated Amsterdam, the 21st of 7th mo. (September),
1677. It concludes with these words:]</p>

<p>"From him who is a lover of Truth, righteousness,
and peace, who desires your temporal and eternal
good; and that in the wisdom of God that is from
above, pure, gentle, and peaceable, you may be ordered,
and order all things, that God hath committed
to you, to His glory; and stop those things among
Christians, so far as you have power, which dishonour

<p>[Here is an incident of travel in Germany.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Being clear of Hamburg, we took leave of Friends
there, whom we left well; and taking John Hill with
us, passed by boat to a city in the Duke of Luneburg's
country; where, after we were examined by the
guards, we were taken to the main-guard, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
examined more strictly; but after they found we
were not soldiers, they were civil, and let us pass.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we travelled by wagon, and the
waters being much out, by reason of heavy rains,
when it drew towards night we hired a boy on the
way to guide us through a great water we had to pass.
When we came to it, the water was so deep, before
we could come at the bridge, that the wagoner had to
wade, and I drove the wagon.</p>

<p>When we were come on the bridge, the horses
broke part of it down, and one of them fell into the
water, the wagon standing upon that part of the
bridge which remained unbroken; and it was the
Lord's mercy to us that the wagon did not run into
the brook. When they had got the horse out, he lay
a while as if dead; but at length they got him up, put
him to the wagon again, and laid the planks right;
and then, through the goodness of the Lord to us,
we got safe over.</p>

<p>After this we came to another water. Finding it
to be very deep, and it being in the night, we hired
two men to help us through, who put cords to the
wagon to hold it by, that the force of the water might
not drive it from the way. But when we came into
it, the stream was so strong that it took one of the
horses off his legs, and was carrying him down the
stream. I called to the wagoner to pluck him to him
by his reins, which he did, and the horse recovered
his legs; and with much difficulty we got over the
bridge, and went to Bremerhaven, the town where
the wagoner lived.</p>

<p>It was the last day of the Sixth month that we escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
these dangers; and it being about eleven at
night when we came in here, we got some fresh straw,
and lay upon it until about four in the morning.
Then, getting up, we set forward again towards Bremen,
by wagon and boat.</p>

<p>On the way I had good opportunities to publish
Truth among the people, especially at a market-town,
where we stayed to change our passage. Here I declared
the Truth to the people, warning them of the
day of the Lord, that was coming upon all flesh; and
exhorting them to righteousness, telling them that
God was come to teach His people Himself, and that
they should turn to the Lord, and hearken to the
teachings of His Spirit in their own hearts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[While the work was going forward in these fresh
fields, trouble was increasing at home, as this brief letter
shows:]</p></blockquote>

<p>Next day, feeling a concern upon my mind with
relation to those seducing spirits that made division
among Friends, and being sensible that they endeavoured
to insinuate themselves into the affectionate
part, I was moved to write a few lines to Friends concerning
them, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All these that set up themselves in the affections
of the people, set up themselves, and the affections of
the people, and not Christ. But Friends, your peaceable
habitation in the Truth, which is everlasting,
and changes not, will outlast all the habitations of
those that are out of the Truth, be they ever so full
of words. So they that are so keen for John Story
and John Wilkinson, let them take them, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
separation; and you that have given your testimony
against that spirit, stand in your testimony, till they
answer by condemnation. Do not strive, nor make
bargains with that which is out of the Truth; nor
save that alive to be a sacrifice for God, which should
be slain, lest you lose your kingdom.</p>

<p>After some time George Keith and William Penn
came back from Germany<a name="FNanchor_BF_235" id="FNanchor_BF_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF_235" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a> to Amsterdam, and had a
dispute with one Galenus Abrahams (one of the most
noted Baptists in Holland), at which many professors
were present; but not having time to finish the dispute
then, they met again, two days after, and the
Baptist was much confounded, and Truth gained
ground.<a name="FNanchor_178_236" id="FNanchor_178_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_236" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding our spirits clear of the service which the
Lord had given us to do in Holland, we took leave of
Friends of Rotterdam, and passed by boat to the
Briel, in order to take passage that day for England.
Several Friends of Rotterdam accompanied us, and
some of Amsterdam, who were come to see us
again before we left Holland. But the packet not
coming in till night, we lodged that night at the Briel;
and next day, being the 21st of the Eighth month,
and the first day of the week, we went on board, and
set sail about ten, viz., William Penn, George Keith,
and I, and Gertrude Dirick Nieson, with her children.</p>

<p>We were in all about sixty passengers, and had a
long and hazardous passage; for the winds were contrary
and the weather stormy. The boat also was
very leaky, insomuch that we had to have two pumps
continually going, day and night; so that it was
thought there was quite as much water pumped out
as the vessel would have held. But the Lord, who is
able to make the stormy winds to cease, and the raging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
waves of the sea calm, yea, to raise them and stop
them at His pleasure, He alone did preserve us;
praised be His name for ever!</p>

<p>Though our passage was hard, yet we had a fine
time, and good service for Truth on board among the
passengers, some of whom were great folks, and were
very kind and loving. We arrived at Harwich on
the 23d, at night, having been two nights and almost
three days at sea.</p>

<p>Next morning William Penn and George Keith
took horse for Colchester; but I stayed, and had a
meeting at Harwich. There being no Colchester
coach there, and the postmaster's wife being unreasonable
in her demands for a coach, and deceiving us
of it also after we had hired it, we went to a Friend's
house about a mile and a half in the country, and
hired his wagon, which we bedded well with straw,
and rode in it to Colchester.</p>

<p>I stayed there till First-day, having a desire to be
at Friends' meeting that day; and a very large and
weighty one it was; for Friends, hearing of my return
from Holland, flocked from several parts of the country,
and many of the townspeople coming in also, it
was thought there were about a thousand people at
it; and all was peaceable.</p>

<p>I stayed at Bristol all the time of the fair, and
some time after. Many sweet and precious meetings
we had; many Friends being there from several parts
of the nation, some on account of trade, and some in
the service of Truth. Great was the love and unity
of Friends that abode faithful in the Truth, though
some who were gone out of the holy unity, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
run into strife, division, and enmity, were rude and
abusive, and behaved themselves in a very unchristian
manner towards me.<a name="FNanchor_179_237" id="FNanchor_179_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_237" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>But the Lord's power was over all; by which being
preserved in heavenly patience, which can bear injuries
for His name's sake, I felt dominion therein
over the rough, rude, and unruly spirits; and left
them to the Lord, who knew my innocency, and
would plead my cause. The more these laboured to
reproach and vilify me, the more did the love of
Friends that were sincere and upright-hearted,
abound towards me; and some that had been betrayed
by the adversaries, seeing their envy and rude behaviour,
broke off from them.</p>

<p>About two weeks after I came to London, the
yearly meeting began, to which Friends came up out
of most parts of the nation, and a glorious, heavenly
meeting we had. Oh, the glory, majesty, love, life,
wisdom, and unity, that were amongst us! The
power reigned over all, and many testimonies were
borne therein against that ungodly spirit which
sought to make rents and divisions amongst the
Lord's people; but not one mouth was opened
amongst us in its defence, or on its behalf.</p>

<p>Good and comfortable accounts also we had, for
the most part, from Friends in other countries; of
which I find a brief account in a letter which soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
after I wrote to my wife, the copy whereof here follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Heart</span>:</p>

<p>"To whom is my love in the everlasting Seed of
life that reigns over all. Great meetings here have
been, and the Lord's power hath been stirring
through all. The Lord hath in His power knit
Friends wonderfully together, and His glorious presence
did appear among them. And now the meetings
are over, blessed be the Lord! in quietness and peace.</p>

<p>"From Holland I hear things are well there: some
Friends are gone that way, to be at their Yearly
Meeting at Amsterdam. At Embden, Friends that
were banished are got into the city again.</p>

<p>"At Dantzic, Friends are in prison, and the magistrates
threatened them with harder imprisonment;
but the next day the Lutherans rose, and plucked
down (or defaced) the Popish monastery; so they
have work enough among themselves.</p>

<p>"The King of Poland received my letter, and read
it himself; and Friends have since printed it in High
Dutch.<a name="FNanchor_180_238" id="FNanchor_180_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_238" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> By letters from the Half-Yearly Meeting
in Ireland, I hear that they are all in love there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>
<p>"At Barbadoes, Friends are in quietness, and their
meetings settled in peace. At Antigua also, and
Nevis, Truth prospers, and Friends have their meetings
orderly and well. Likewise in New England and
other places, things concerning Truth and Friends
are well; and in those places the men's and women's
meetings are settled; blessed be the Lord!</p>

<p>"So keep in God's power and Seed, that is over all,
in whom ye all have life and salvation; for the Lord
reigns over all in His glory, and in His kingdom;
glory to His name forever, Amen.</p>

<p>"In haste, with my love to you all, and to all
Friends.</p>

<h3>1679-1691.</h3>


<blockquote>

<p>[The year 1679 was spent almost entirely in retirement
at Swarthmore, but in 1680 the activity and
travels begin again. This last decade of Fox's life finds
him much of the time in or about London, for there
are new storms to be met, and he could not lie at ease
in the "North." The Wilkinson-Story movement in
opposition to a settled system of government and discipline
made his presence in the "South" necessary.
But even more than for this was he concerned over the
fresh spasm of persecution which during the closing
years of Charles' reign filled the prisons and jails with
Quakers. Whenever or wherever the "Conventicle
Act" was enforced Friends were sure to have the large
end of the suffering to bear.]</p></blockquote>

<p>After this I was moved of the Lord to visit
Friends in some parts of Surrey and Sussex. I went
to Kingston by water, and tarried certain days; for
while I was there, the Lord laid it upon me to write
both to the great Turk, and the Dey of Algiers, severally,
to warn them, and the people under them, to
turn from their wickedness, fear the Lord, and do
justly; lest the judgments of God should come upon
them, and destroy them without remedy. To the
Algerines I wrote more particularly concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
cruelty they exercised towards Friends and others,
whom they held captives in Algiers.</p>

<p>At Hertford I met with John Story, and some
others of his party; but the testimony of Truth went
over them, and kept them down, so that the meeting
was quiet.</p>

<p>It was on a First-day; and the next day being the
men's and women's meeting for business, I visited
them also, and the rather because some in that place
had let in a disesteem of them. Wherefore I was
moved to open the service of those meetings, and the
usefulness and benefit thereof to the Church of
Christ, as the Lord opened the thing in me; and it
was of good service to Friends.</p>

<p>I had a meeting also with some of those that were
gone into strife and contention, to show them wherein
they were wrong; and having cleared myself of them,
I left them to the Lord.</p>

<p>I abode at London most part of this winter,<a name="FNanchor_BG_239" id="FNanchor_BG_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG_239" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a> having
much service for the Lord there, both in and out
of meetings: for as it was a time of great suffering
among Friends, I was drawn in spirit to visit Friends'
meetings more frequently; to encourage and
strengthen them both by exhortation and example.
The Parliament also was sitting, and Friends were
diligent in waiting upon them, to lay their grievances
before them.</p>

<p>We received fresh accounts almost every day of
the sad sufferings Friends underwent in many parts
of the nation. In seeking relief for my suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
brethren I spent much time; together with other
Friends, who were freely given up to that service,
attending at the Parliament-House for many days
together, and watching all opportunities to speak
with such members of either House as would hear our
just complaints.</p>

<p>Indeed, some of these were very courteous to us,
and appeared willing to help us if they could; but the
Parliament being then earnest in examining the
Popish plot, and contriving ways to discover such as
were Popishly affected, our adversaries took advantage
against us (because they knew we could not
swear nor fight) to expose us to those penalties that
were made against Papists; though they knew in
their consciences that we were no Papists, and had
had experience of us, that we were no plotters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sufferings continuing severe upon Friends at London,<a name="FNanchor_BH_240" id="FNanchor_BH_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH_240" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a>
I found my service lay mostly there; wherefore
I went but little out of town, and not far; being frequent
at the most public meetings, to encourage
Friends, both by word and example, to stand fast in
the testimony to which God had called them.</p>

<p>At other times I went about from house to house,
visiting Friends that had their goods taken away for
their testimony to Truth; because the wicked informers
were grown very audacious, by reason that
they had too much countenance and encouragement
from some justices, who, trusting wholly to their information,
proceeded against Friends without hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
them; whereby many were made to suffer, not
only contrary to right, but even contrary to law also.<a name="FNanchor_181_241" id="FNanchor_181_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_241" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Now I had some inclination to go into the country
to a meeting, but hearing that there would be a bustle
at our meetings, and feeling a great disquietness
in people's spirits in the city about choosing sheriffs,
it was upon me to stay in the city, and go to the meeting
in Gracechurch street upon the first day of the
week. William Penn went with me, and spoke; and
while he was declaring the Truth to the people, a constable
came in with his great staff, and bade him give
over, and come down; but he continued, declaring
Truth in the power of God.</p>

<p>After a while the constable drew back, and when
William Penn had done, I stood up, and declared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
the people the everlasting gospel, which was preached
in the apostles' days, and to Abraham; and which the
Church in the apostles' days received, and came to
be heirs of.</p>

<p>As I was thus speaking, two constables came in
with their great staves, and bade me give over speaking,
and come down; but, feeling the power of the
Lord with me, I spoke on therein, both to the constables
and to the people. To the constables I declared
that we were a peaceable people, who meet to wait
upon God, and worship Him in spirit and in truth;
and therefore they needed not to come with their
staves amongst us, who were met in a peaceable manner,
desiring and seeking the good and salvation of all
people.</p>

<p>Then turning my speech to the people again, I declared
what further was upon me to them; and while
I was speaking, the constables drew out towards the
door; and the soldiers stood with their muskets in
the yard.</p>

<p>When I had done speaking, I kneeled down and
prayed, desiring the Lord to open the eyes and hearts
of all people, both high and low, that their minds
might be turned to God by His Holy Spirit; that He
might be glorified in all and over all. After prayer
the meeting rose, and Friends passed away; the constables
being come in again, but without the soldiers;
and indeed, both they and the soldiers carried themselves
civilly.</p>

<p>William Penn and I went into a room hard by, as
we used to do, and many Friends went with us; and
lest the constables should think we would shun them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
a Friend went down and told them that if they would
have anything with us, they might come where we
were, if they pleased.</p>

<p>On First-day it was upon me to go to Devonshire-House
meeting in the afternoon; and because I had
heard Friends were kept out there that morning (as
they were that day at most meetings about the city),
I went sooner, and got into the yard before the soldiers
came to guard the passages. But the constables
were there before me, and stood in the doorway with
their staves.</p>

<p>I asked them to let me go in. They said they could
not, durst not; for they were commanded the contrary,
and were sorry for it.</p>

<p>I told them I would not press upon them; so I
stood by, and they were very civil.</p>

<p>I stood till I was weary, and then one gave me a
stool to sit down on; and after a while the power of
the Lord began to spring up among Friends, and one
began to speak.</p>

<p>The constables soon forbade him, and said he
should not speak; and he not stopping, they began to
be wroth. But I gently laid my hand upon one of the
constables, and wished him to let the Friend alone.
The constable did so, and was quiet; and the man did
not speak long. After he had done, I was moved to
stand up and speak.</p>

<p>I then sat down; and after a while I was moved to
pray. The power of the Lord was over all; and the
people, the constables and soldiers put off their hats.</p>

<p>When the meeting was done, and Friends began to
pass away, the constable put off his hat, and desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
the Lord to bless us; for the power of the Lord was
over him and the people, and kept them under.</p>

<p>I tarried in and near London, visiting Friends'
meetings, and labouring in the service of the gospel,
till the yearly meeting came on, which began on the
28th of the Third month. It was a time of great sufferings;
and much concerned I was lest Friends that
came up out of the country on the Church's service,
should be taken and imprisoned at London. But the
Lord was with us; His power preserved us, and gave
us a sweet and blessed opportunity to wait upon Him,
to be refreshed together in Him, and to perform His
services for His truth and people for which we met.</p>

<p>As it was a time of great persecution, and we
understood that in most counties Friends were under
great sufferings, either by imprisonments or spoiling
of goods, or both, a concern was weightily upon me
lest any Friends that were sufferers, especially such
as were traders and dealers in the world, should hazard
the losing of other men's goods or estates through
their sufferings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the First-day following<a name="FNanchor_BI_242" id="FNanchor_BI_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI_242" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> I went to the meeting
at Gracechurch street. When I came there, I found
three constables in the meeting-house, who kept
Friends out; so we met in the court.</p>

<p>After I had been some time there, I stood up and
spoke to the people, and continued speaking some
time. Then one of the constables came, and took hold
of my hand, and said, "You must come down." I
desired him to be patient, and went on speaking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
the people; but after a little time he pulled me down,
and took me into the meeting-house.</p>

<p>I asked them if they were not weary of this work.
One of them said, "Indeed we are." They let me go
into the widow Foster's house, which joined the meeting-house,
where I stayed, being hot.</p>

<p>When the meeting was ended, for one prayed after
I was taken away, the constables asked some Friends
which of them would pass their words that I should
appear, if they should be questioned about me. But
the Friends told them they need not require that, for
I was a man well known in the city to be one that
would neither fly nor shrink. So they went away,
and I heard no further of it.</p>

<p>I continued yet at London, labouring in the work
and service of the Lord, both in and out of meetings;
sometimes visiting Friends in prison for the testimony
of Jesus, encouraging them in their sufferings,
and exhorting them to stand faithful and steadfast in
the testimony, which the Lord had committed to
them to bear. Sometimes also I visited those that
were sick and weak in body, or troubled in mind,
helping to bear up their spirits from sinking under
their infirmities. Sometimes our meetings were
quiet and peaceable; sometimes they were disturbed
and broken up by the officers.</p>

<p>As I was speaking in the power of the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_BJ_243" id="FNanchor_BJ_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ_243" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> and
the people were greatly affected therewith, suddenly
the constables, with the rude people, came in like a
sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the constables said to me, "Come down";
and he laid hands on me.</p>

<p>I asked him, "Art thou a Christian? We are
Christians."</p>

<p>He had hold of my hand, and was very fierce to
pluck me down; but I stood still, and spoke a few
words to the people; desiring of the Lord that the
blessings of God might rest upon them all.</p>

<p>The constable still called upon me to come down,
and at length plucked me down, and bade another
man with a staff take me and carry me to prison.
That man led me to the house of another officer, who
was more civil; and after a while they brought in
four Friends more, whom they had taken.</p>

<p>I was very weary, and in a great perspiration; and
several Friends, hearing where I was, came to me in
the constable's house; but I bade them all go their
ways, lest the constables and informers should stop
them.</p>

<p>After a while the constables led us almost a mile to
a justice, who was a fierce, passionate man. After
he had asked me my name, and his clerk had taken it
in writing, upon the constable's informing him that
I had preached in the meeting, he said in an angry
manner, "Do not you know that it is contrary to the
King's laws to preach in such conventicles, contrary
to the Liturgy of the Church of England?"</p>

<p>There was present one &mdash;&mdash; Shad (a wicked informer,
who was said to have broken jail at Coventry,
and to have been burned in the hand at London),
who, hearing the justice speak so to me, stepped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
to him and told him that he had convicted them on
the Act of the 22d of King Charles the Second.</p>

<p>"What! you convict them?" said the justice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Shad, "I have convicted them, and
you must convict them too upon that Act."</p>

<p>With that the justice was angry with him, and
said, "You teach me! what are you? I'll convict
them of a riot."</p>

<p>The informer hearing that and seeing the justice
angry, went away in a fret; so he was disappointed of
his purpose.</p>

<p>Now had I drawings in Spirit to go into Holland,
to visit the Seed of God there.<a name="FNanchor_BK_244" id="FNanchor_BK_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK_244" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a> And as soon as the
yearly meeting was over I prepared for my journey.
There went with me from London Alexander Parker,
George Watts, and Nathaniel Brassey, who also had
drawings into that country.</p>

<p>We took coach the 31st of the Third month, 1684,
and got to Colchester that night. Next day being
First-day, we went to the meeting there; and though
there was no notice given of my coming, yet our
being there was presently spread over the town, and
in several places in the country at seven and ten miles
distance; so that abundance of Friends came in
double-horsed, which made the meeting very large.</p>

<p>I had a concern and travail in my mind, lest this
great gathering should stir up the town, and be more
than the magistrates could well bear. But it was
very quiet and peaceable, and a glorious meeting we
had, to the settling and establishing of Friends both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
in town and country; for the Lord's power was over
all; blessed be His name for ever!</p>

<p>Truly the Lord's power and presence was beyond
words; for I was but weak to go into a meeting, and
my face (by reason of a cold I had taken) was sore;
but God manifested His strength in us and with us,
and all was well. The Lord have the glory for evermore,
for His supporting power!<a name="FNanchor_182_245" id="FNanchor_182_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_245" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>It was the latter end of the summer when I came
to London, where I stayed the winter following; saving
that once or twice, my wife being in town with
me, I went with her to her son Rous's at Kingston.
And though my body was very weak, yet I was in
continual service, either in public meetings, when I
was able to bear them, or in particular business
amongst Friends, and visiting those that were sufferers
for Truth, either by imprisonment or loss of
goods.</p>

<p>Many things also in this time I wrote, some for the
press, and some for particular service; as letters to
the King of Denmark and Duke of Holstein on behalf
of Friends that were sufferers in their dominions.<a name="FNanchor_183_246" id="FNanchor_183_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_246" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>
<p>The yearly meeting coming on, I was much concerned
for Friends that came up to it out of the country,
lest they should meet with any trouble or disturbance
in their passage up or down; and the rather
because about that time a great bustle arose in the
nation upon the Duke of Monmouth's landing in the
West.<a name="FNanchor_184_247" id="FNanchor_184_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_247" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But the Lord, according to His wonted goodness,
was graciously pleased to preserve Friends in
safety, and gave us a blessed opportunity to meet
together in peace and quietness, and accompanied our
meeting with His living, refreshing presence: blessed
for ever be His holy name!</p>

<p>Considering the hurries that were in the nation, it
came upon me at the close of this meeting to write a
few lines to Friends, to caution all to keep out of the
spirit of the world, in which trouble is, and to dwell
in the peaceable Truth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I came back to London in the First month, 1686,
and set myself with all diligence to look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
Friends' sufferings, from which we had now some
hopes of getting relief. The sessions came on in the
Second month at Hicks's-Hall, where many Friends
had appeals to be tried. I was with these from day
to day, to advise them, and to see that no opportunity
was slipped nor advantage lost; and they generally
succeeded well.</p>

<p>Soon after the King was pleased, upon our often
laying our sufferings before him, to give order for the
releasing of all prisoners for conscience' sake that
were in his power to discharge. Thereby the prison-doors
were opened, and many hundreds of Friends,
some of whom had been long in prison, were set at
liberty.<a name="FNanchor_185_248" id="FNanchor_185_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_248" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Some of those who had for many years been restrained
in bonds, came now up to the yearly meeting,
which was in the Third month this year. This
caused great joy to Friends, to see our ancient, faithful
brethren again at liberty in the Lord's work, after
their long confinement. And indeed a precious meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
we had; the refreshing presence of the Lord appearing
plentifully with us and amongst us.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Gradually Fox was growing physically weaker, and,
though his pen was busy with documents and letters,
he records almost nothing in his Journal.]</p></blockquote>

<p>In the Seventh month<a name="FNanchor_BL_249" id="FNanchor_BL_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL_249" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a> I returned to London,
having been near three months in the country for my
health's sake, which was very much impaired; so that
I was hardly able to stay in a meeting the whole time;
and often after a meeting had to lie down on a bed.
Yet did not my weakness of body take me off from
the service of the Lord, but I continued to labour in
and out of meetings, in His work, as He gave me opportunity
and ability.</p>

<p>I had not been long in London before a great
weight came upon me, and the Lord gave me a sight
of the great bustles and troubles, revolution and
change, which soon after came to pass. In the sense
thereof, and in the movings of the Spirit of the
Lord, I wrote "A general epistle to Friends, to forewarn
them of the approaching storm, that they might
all retire to the Lord, in whom is safety."<a name="FNanchor_186_250" id="FNanchor_186_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_250" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>About this time great exercises and weights came
upon me (as they had usually done before the great
revolutions and changes of government), and my
strength departed from me; so that I reeled, and was
ready to fall, as I went along the streets. At length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
I could not go abroad at all, I was so weak, for some
time, till I felt the power of the Lord to spring over
all, and had received an assurance from Him, that He
would preserve His faithful people to Himself
through all.</p>

<p>About the middle of the First month, 1688-9,<a name="FNanchor_BM_251" id="FNanchor_BM_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM_251" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a> I
went to London, the Parliament then sitting, and engaged
about the bill for indulgence. Though I was
weak in body, and not well able to stir about, yet so
great a concern was upon my spirit on behalf of
Truth and Friends, that I attended continually for
many days, with other Friends, at the Parliament-House,
labouring with the members, that the thing
might be done comprehensively and effectually.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I remained at London till the beginning of the
Ninth month,<a name="FNanchor_BN_252" id="FNanchor_BN_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN_252" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a> being continually exercised in the
work of the Lord, either in public meetings, opening
the way of Truth to people, and building up and
establishing Friends therein, or in other services
relating to the Church of God. For the Parliament
now sitting, and having a bill before them concerning
oaths, and another concerning clandestine marriages,
several Friends attended the House, to get those bills
so worded that they might not be hurtful to Friends.
In this service I also assisted, attending on the Parliament,
and discoursing the matter with several of the
members.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Here follows (January 10th, 1691) the last entry in
the Journal, with the letter written to the Irish
Friends who were enduring almost indescribable sufferings,
occasioned by the civil war in Ireland.]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after I returned to London, and was
almost daily with Friends at meetings. When I had
been near two weeks in town, the sense of the great
hardships and sore sufferings that Friends had been
and were under in Ireland, coming with great weight
upon me, I was moved to write an epistle, as a word
of consolation unto them.<a name="FNanchor_187_253" id="FNanchor_187_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_253" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>[The next day he went to Gracechurch Street Meeting,
which was large and in which he preached a long
and powerful sermon, "opening many deep and
weighty things." He then offered prayer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
meeting closed. When some Friends came to his room
in White-Hart-Court, later in the day, he told them he
had "felt the cold strike to his heart, as he came out
of meeting"; "yet," he added, "I am glad I was here
(i. e., in the meeting). Now I am clear, I am fully
clear!" Later, when Friends were visiting him, he
said: "All is well; the Seed of God reigns over all and
over death itself. And though I am weak in body, yet
the power of God is over all, and the Seed reigns over
all disorderly spirits." "Lying thus in a heavenly
frame of mind, his spirit wholly exercised towards the
Lord," he fell asleep in peace on the evening of January
13th, 1691. The funeral was attended by a very
large concourse of people, and the body was laid in the
burying-ground near Bunhill Fields, where the grave
is now marked with a modest stone. Few men in the
dying hour could say more truly, "I am clear."]</p></blockquote>

seem to need many. Centuries pass, as He orders history, in which there
are none. So we call them Dark Ages. Then comes some John in the
desert, and the world is wakened; some Wesley in the Church of England,
and there is a revival of religion.
</p>
<p>
"For our English races, since there were English races, I count three
or four such prophets; for the world of Europe I count perhaps eleven
worthy of our gratitude to-day. I mean the gratitude of all mankind.
Saint Paul and Saint John are two; Augustine of Hippo is three;
Dante and Francis of Assisi are two more; Thomas à Kempis and Jacob
Böhme, two more; and, coming across to England, Wiclif, John Milton,
George Fox, and John Wesley."&mdash;<em>Edward Everett Hale, in an Address
at the Wesley Bicentennial Celebration in People's Temple, Boston.</em>
</p>
<p>
"The three most influential Englishmen of the last three centuries
were George Fox, John Wesley and John Henry Newman. Those who
wish really to understand those three centuries must read, mark, learn,
and inwardly digest Fox's Journal, Wesley's Journal, and Newman's
Apologia. The entire future of England and the English Empire
depends upon the answer to this question: Will Newman defeat Fox
and Wesley, or will Fox and Wesley defeat Newman?"

which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of shams, it was a religion
of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a return to something
more like the original gospel truth than men had ever known in
England. So far as our Christian sects to-day are evolving into liberality,
they are simply reverting in essence to the position which Fox
and the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one can pretend for a
moment that in point of spiritual sagacity and capacity, Fox's mind
was unsound. Every one who confronted him personally, from Oliver
Cromwell down to county magistrates and jailers, seems to have
acknowledged his superior power."

farming country. The house in which George Fox was
born has long since vanished, and the few cottages

of modern structure. An obelisk, with a long inscription,

used by Carlyle in his famous characterization
of George Fox. (See "Sartor Resartus," book iii.,
chapter 1: "An Incident in Modern History.") There
is, however, no historical foundation for Carlyle's picture.
Sewel denies that there was any connection between
Fox's suit of leather and "his former leather-work."

lived in Nottingham.</p></div>

It will come often. It means that the persons to whom

<p><a name="Footnote_9_15" id="Footnote_9_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_15"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> From his return home in 1644, George Fox dates

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_17" id="Footnote_10_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_17"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> It was a settled custom, in fact, a matter of conscience
with Fox, to avoid the names of the days and of
the months. He disliked them because they commemorated
heathen divinities, and he always makes a point
of using numeral adjectives instead of the names. It
was not an original scruple with him, but a similar position
was taken by some of the leading "Separatists"
before the Commonwealth period. (See Barrow's
"False Churches," p. 204.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_11_20" id="Footnote_11_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_20"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> It is difficult to find out where George Fox's money
came from. He reports in the original MS. of the
Journal, p. 17, a remark his relatives made about him
when he left home: "When hee went from us hee had
a greate deale of gould and sillver about him." He is
always well supplied. He goes to inns, always has a
good horse, wears clean linen and frequently gives to
charity. In signed papers in the Spence collection he
gives orders for the disposal of money invested "in
ships and trade," as well as of a thousand acres of land
in Pennsylvania which William Penn had assigned to
him.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_21" id="Footnote_12_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_21"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> This expression "opened" has a mystical import,
and will be of frequent occurrence. He means to say
that it was directly revealed in his soul so that he assuredly
knew it to be true. Often he uses the expression
in reference to some truth which he might easily
have discovered in the Scriptures or have learned from
contemporary sources. But in this solemn way he announces
that this truth has now at length come to be a
<em>living truth for him</em>. It is no longer a mere statement
of fact&mdash;it is a principle, the truth of which he <em>sees</em>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_14_24" id="Footnote_14_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_24"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> "Friends" is here used for the first time in the
Journal as the name of the new denomination. It is
not possible to determine when the name was adopted
or why it was chosen. When the Journal was written
the term had already become fixed and Fox uses it
without comment or explanation, referring it back to
a period before it came into use as the name of the
Society. At first the word "friends" was probably
used in an untechnical sense for those who were
<em>friendly</em>, and little by little it hardened into a name.
At the very beginning they called themselves "Children
of the Light."</p></div>

often. They claimed to be perfect and above the possibility
of sinning. Some even went to the wild extreme
of claiming to be Christ, or God. They went on living
for the most part much as they chose, and justified
their acts on the ground that it was God who was acting
in them. It is clearly apparent from this autobiography
that such persons were very numerous at the
time. It will be noticed that George Fox believes also
in the possibility of freedom from sin, but perfection as
he holds it means something quite other than this doctrine
of the Ranters, as the Journal will show.</p></div>

who was born in Nottingham about the year 1600. She
was the first person of her sex to become a minister in
the newly-gathered Society. The preaching of women
at this time was not entirely novel, as it was allowed by
several of the religious sects of the period. Elizabeth
Hooton had her faith severely tested by persecution
and long imprisonment. She performed two religious
visits to America and the West Indies and died in Jamaica
in 1671.</p></div>

and <em>knowledge</em>&mdash;what is here called "knowledge in the
Spirit" and "knowledge in the flesh," or, what is perhaps
more frequently called "knowledge of the heart"
and "knowledge of the head." The latter expression
means a knowledge of fact&mdash;the knowing that a thing
is so by evidence which satisfies the mind. The former
expression means the soul's immediate grasp of truth
by the test of practical experience. The goal in one
case is the establishment of some fact; the goal in the
other case is the production of positive life and character
by the appreciation of the truth.</p></div>

George Fox evidently preached the possibility of complete
freedom from sin. But he was very careful to
avoid presenting the mere theory or "notion" of perfection,
which was common among all the types of
"Ranters." He believed that Christ came to destroy
sin, and he stoutly held that when He ruled in a man
sin and the dominion of it were done away. Man
could come into "the condition Adam was in before he
fell," to use his own expression. One of his most frequent
challenges was to demand that modern Christians
should come into "the same life and power which
those were in who gave forth the Scriptures." But
George Fox's test of holiness was the practical test of
daily life. No man was to be accounted holy if he were
not <em>in fact</em> holy.</p></div>

of George Fox this is one of the most important passages
in the Journal. These sweeping psychical and
physical changes are most significant. On two other
occasions of his life, which will be noted later, he underwent
similar, though perhaps profounder, changes.
These passages in the Journal reveal, to those who are
familiar with such phenomena, the fact that George
Fox was subject to deep subliminal transformations.
The passage, too, throws much light back upon his long
travail through distress and darkness.</p></div>

"But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardness

and fulness of his words, have often struck, even
strangers, with admiration, as they used to reach others
with consolation. The most awful, living, reverent

is undated. It is strangely like an experience
of the great German mystic, Jacob Boehme, whose
works were published in England about the time Fox
was beginning his missionary labors. He, too, had all
nature opened to him, so that he says he saw the true
significance and essence of things. See Jacob Boehme,
"Signatura Rerum," which was published in English
in 1649. Muggleton, in his "Looking Glass for G.
Fox" (second edition, 1756, page 10), says that the
writings of Boehme are the "chief books" bought by
the followers of Fox.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_46" id="Footnote_31_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_46"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> One could wish that this important account of
Fox's practical mission to the world were more clearly
expressed than is here done in his phraseology, which
needs translation into modern terms. There is, he
means to say, a universal Divine principle or law of
life which finds expression or voice in every soul.
"That of God" in the individual "answers" or corresponds
with the universal Divine principle. But,
unfortunately, this Divine Light within is disobeyed,
and thus men are astray&mdash;out of their true life and
function. Fox's mission is to call all such to obedience
to "that of God" within them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32_47" id="Footnote_32_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_47"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> This is the central teaching of George Fox.
Everything else comes out of this elemental truth. It
is, as he says, clearly enough taught in the Scriptures,
but he now saw the truth as an immediate revelation&mdash;as
a primary fact of experience.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_48" id="Footnote_33_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_48"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The soul's own assurance of salvation was well proclaimed
by Luther, but the high and joyous experience
was well-nigh lost in Calvinistic England. Fox reaffirms
the privilege of this experience. He proclaims
no man's infallibility, but rather the infallibility of the
Spirit, in union with which a man may know that he
pleases God.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34_49" id="Footnote_34_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_49"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> By a clear spiritual insight Fox saw how large a
contribution both Judaism and Paganism had made to
the historic church. He went to work to carry the
reformation to its logical conclusion. To re-instate
primitive Christianity was his aim.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35_50" id="Footnote_35_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_50"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The real principles here involved were simplicity
of life, equal respect for <em>all</em> men alike, and strict sincerity.
It must be confessed that these principles
have sometimes been lost sight of, and dress and language
have sometimes become a form to those who opposed all forms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36_52" id="Footnote_36_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_52"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> This is one of the very few instances in his entire
career when Fox interrupted a minister. It was
neither illegal nor contrary to custom for any one to
speak after the minister was done&mdash;a privilege which
Fox often used. On this particular occasion, his feeling
overmastered him, and he spoke before his time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37_53" id="Footnote_37_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_53"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> This gives a glimpse at the medical practice of the
time. Fox frequently showed remarkable power in
dealing with cases of hysteria, such as the one here
reported. He evidently did not understand the nature
of the disease. But his commanding presence, his
piercing eye (testified to by even his persecutors), and
the absolute assurance which his voice gave that he was
equal to the occasion, were worth a thousand doctors
with their lancets. Those who understand the psychology
of suggestion, and the effect of faith on certain
diseases, will hardly question the simple accounts given
here and elsewhere.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38_54" id="Footnote_38_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_54"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> As everywhere, he is interested in the state of the

<p><a name="Footnote_41_57" id="Footnote_41_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_57"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Here begins Fox's first serious imprisonment. The
charge was direct and distinct. He was committed as a
blasphemer. Under the law passed by both Houses of
Parliament, in 1648, Fox might easily have been condemned
to suffer a death penalty. It was an offense,
punishable by death, to deny that the Scriptures are
the Word of God, or that the bodies of men shall rise
after they are dead. It was blasphemy to say that the
two sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are
not commanded by God. It was also blasphemy to
declare that man has by nature free will to turn to
God. It was, of course, not difficult to find a charge
of the violation of this drag-net act.
</p>
<p>
From Derby prison he wrote many letters, to the
magistrates, to the justices, to the "priests," to the
court at Derby, to the mayor, to the individual justices,
and to "the ringers of bells in steeple-houses." He
calls them all to obedience to the light within them.
"Mind that which is eternal and invisible." "Keep
in the innocency and be obedient to the faith in Him."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42_58" id="Footnote_42_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_58"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> This is the whole of our data for the origin of the
name "Quaker." Fox told the Justice to tremble at the
word of the Lord, and the Justice thereupon fixed the
name "quaker" upon him. There is probably, however,
something back of this particular incident which
helped give the name significance. The editors of the
New English Dictionary (see the word Quaker) have
discovered the fact that this name for a religious sect
was not entirely new at this time. Letter No. 2,624 of
the Clarendon collection, written in 1647, speaks of a
sect from the continent possessed of a remarkable
capacity for trembling or quaking: "I heare of a sect
of woemen (they are at Southworke) come from beyond
the Sea, called quakers, and these swell, shiver and
shake, and when they come to themselves (for in all
this fitt Mahomett's holy-ghost hath bin conversing
with them) they begin to preach what hath been delivered
to them by the Spirit." It seems probable that
Justice Bennet merely employed a term of reproach
already familiar. It is, further, evident that the
Friends themselves were sometimes given to trembling,
and that the name came into general use because it
fitted. (See Sewel's "History of the People Called
Quakers," Vol. I., p. 63. Philadelphia, 1823.) The
name first appears in the records of Parliament, in the
Journals of the House of Commons, in 1654.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_45_61" id="Footnote_45_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_61"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> It must be remembered that this act of George Fox
occurred at the close of a year of imprisonment,
part of which had been in a horrible jail. He
was throughout his life restless and active to an
extreme degree. For an entire year, just as his
work was getting well begun, he had been forced to
live in this nut-shell of a prison&mdash;day after day inactive.
Now he was free again, and the old restlessness
to be doing something came upon him with irresistible
force. He was in no condition to inhibit suggestions.
It is quite possible that some subconscious memory
here gave the suggestion. In 1612 one Wightman was
burned at the stake in Lichfield, and the deed was fresh
in the minds of men at this time. Then the name
Lichfield means "field of dead bodies," a name which
doubtless had its origin in some baptism of blood, and
George in his boyhood may have heard some tale of
those bloody times.</p></div>

with an endurance which is astonishing. This iron constitution
carried him through the long imprisonments

of law or custom for a person in the congregation

Occasionally he interrupted, which was
contrary to good order, but he justified it by an appeal
to the call of the Spirit, which he could not resist. (See

join them. Swarthmore Hall was always open to travelling
ministers, and there is good reason to believe
that substantial assistance went from Swarthmore Hall
to those who were labouring throughout the kingdom.

of the miraculous and most naturally gave him the impression
that he was a peculiarly-chosen instrument of

had been gathered to the work which now
absorbed George Fox. It was a remarkable group of
men,&mdash;young, vigorous, ready speakers, eager for the
hard service, welcoming persecution and undaunted by
any dangers or difficulties. They so completely caught
the idea of Fox that they practically all spoke the same
religious language.
</p>
<p>
To them George Fox addressed a quaint, but strikingly
spiritual, epistle of advice as they went out to
begin their labours. Here are a few sentences from it:
</p>
<p>
"All Friends everywhere, Know the Seed of God,
which bruiseth the seed of the serpent, and is atop of
the seed of the serpent: which Seed sins not, but bruiseth
the serpent's head that doth sin, and that tempts to
sin: to which Seed is God's promise and blessing; and
which Seed is one in the male and in the female....
</p>
<p>
"This is the Word of the Lord to you all: Every one
in the measure of life wait, that with it all your minds
may be guided up to the Father of life, the Father of
spirits: to receive power from Him, and wisdom, that
with it you may be ordered to His glory: to whom be
all glory forever! All keep in the Light and Life, that
judgeth down that which is contrary to the Light and
Life. So the Lord God Almighty be with you all....
</p>
<p>
"All Friends that speak in public, see that it be in
the life of God; for that begets to God; the fruits of
that shall never wither. This sows to the Spirit which
is in prison, and of the Spirit reaps life; and the other
sows to the flesh, and of the flesh reaps corruption.
This you may see all the world over amongst these
seeds-men,&mdash;that which may be reaped in the field, that
is the world. Therefore wait in the Spirit of the Lord,
which cuts down and casts out all this, the root and
branches of it. So in that wait to receive power, and
the Lord God Almighty preserve you in it; whereby
you may come to feel the Light, that comprehends time
and the world, and fathoms it: which, believed in, gives
you victory over the world. Here the power of the
Lord is received, which subdues all the contrary, and
puts off the garments that will stain and pollute."</p></div>

striking men in England. Cromwell's greatest work
was already done; Fox, now thirty years old, was only
getting well under way with his earthly mission. He
never comprehended the greatness of Cromwell's work,
nor did he appreciate the complex tangle which the
Protector had to unravel. He was so sun-clear and ingenuous
himself that he could not fathom a man who
skillfully zigzagged toward the ends which he could
not reach by perfectly direct steps. Carlyle gives a
happy paraphrase of this passage in the Journal: "'I
exhorted him,' writes George, 'to keep in the fear of
God,' whereby he might 'receive Wisdom from
God,' which would be a useful guidance for any sovereign
person. In fact, I had 'much discourse' with
him; explaining what I and Friends had been led to
think 'Concerning Christ and His Apostles' of old
time, and His Priests and Ministers of new; concerning
Life and concerning Death; concerning the Unfathomable
Universe in general, and the Light in it from
Above and the Darkness in it that is from Below: to
all which the Protector 'carried himself with much
moderation.' Yes, George; this Protector has a sympathy
with the Perennial; and feels it across the Temporary:
no hulls, leathern or other, can entirely hide
it from the sense of him." Carlyle's "Oliver Cromwell's
Letters and Speeches." (Centenary Edition.)

Among them was a long letter to all professors of
Christianity. Here is a characteristic passage from it:
</p>
<p>
"Let us be glad, and rejoice for ever! Singleness of
heart is come; pureness of heart is come; joy and gladness
is come. The glorious God is exalting Himself;
Truth hath been talked of, but now it is possessed.
Christ hath been talked of; but now He is come and
possessed. The glory hath been talked of; but now it
is possessed, and the glory of man is defacing. The
Son of God hath been talked of; but now He is come,
and hath given us an understanding. Unity hath been
talked of; but now it is come. Virgins have been talked
of; but now they are come with oil in their lamps."</p></div>

custom was, spent much of his time of imprisonment
writing letters and religious epistles. Here is a sound
word of advice from his Epistle to "Friends": "Be

strain of this strenuous work. A fanatical group got
about him and in a period of evident aberration he
allowed these flattering followers to give him a Triumphal
Entry into Bristol, as Christ, returned in the
flesh. Here is Carlyle's account: "In the month of
October, 1655, there was seen a strange sight at Bristol
in the West. A procession of eight persons: one a man
on horseback, riding single; the others, men and
women, partly riding double, partly on foot, in the
muddiest highway, in the wettest weather; singing, all
but the single-rider, at whose bridle splash and walk
two women: 'Hosannah! Holy, holy! Lord God of Sabaoth!'...
The single-rider is a raw-boned male
figure, 'with lank hair reaching below his cheeks'; hat
drawn close over his brows; of abstruse 'down look'
and large, dangerous jaws, strictly closed; he sings not;
sits there covered, and is sung to by the others, bare.
Amid pouring deluges and mud knee-deep: 'so that the
rain ran in at their necks, and they vented it at their
hose and breeches,' a spectacle to the west of England
and posterity! Singing as above; answering no questions
except in song. At the High Cross, they are laid
hold of by the Authorities; turn out to be James Nayler
and Company." (Carlyle's "Oliver Cromwell's Letters
and Speeches." Vol. III., pp. 223, 224.) What he
needed was mental treatment. What he received was
the harshest punishment Parliament could devise. He
missed the death penalty by a vote of 82 to 96. His
sentence, passed by Parliament December 16th, 1656,
was to be pilloried for two hours, to be whipped by the
hangman through the streets from Westminster to the
Old Exchange in the city, to be pilloried again after
two days for two hours more, to have his tongue bored
through with a red-hot iron, and to be branded in the
forehead with the letter B, to be again flogged through
the streets of Bristol, and then to be committed to
prison with solitary confinement and hard labor during
the pleasure of Parliament. Poor James Nayler!
His fall did the Quakers almost irreparable injury
in public estimation. Fox had already had an intimation
of this trouble. As he left James Nayler in London
he wrote: "As I passed him I cast my eye upon
him and a fear struck me concerning him."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95_126" id="Footnote_95_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95_126"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> His death came not long after his awful punishment,
and just before the end of life he wrote these
words:
</p>
<p>
"There is a spirit which I feel, which delights to do
no evil, nor to revenge any wrong; but delights to endure
all things, in hope to enjoy its own in the end. Its
hope is to outlive all wrath and contention, and to
weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or whatever is of
a nature contrary to itself. It sees to the end of all
temptations; as it bears no evil in itself, so it conceives
none in thought to any other. If it be betrayed, it bears
it; for its ground and spring is the mercy and forgiveness
of God. Its crown is meekness; its life is everlasting
love unfeigned. It takes its kingdom with entreaty,
and not with contention, and keeps it by lowliness of
mind. In God alone it can rejoice, though none else
regard it, or can own its life. It is conceived in sorrow,
and brought forth without any to pity it; nor doth it
murmur at grief and oppression. It never rejoiceth,
but through sufferings; for with the world's joy it is
murdered. I found it alone; being forsaken. I have
fellowship therein, with those who lived in dens and
desolate places in the earth; who through death obtained
this resurrection, and eternal, holy life!"

Cromwell's daughter, who died soon after this
time:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Keep in the fear of the Lord God; that is the Word
of the Lord unto thee. For all these things happen to
thee for thy good, and for the good of those concerned
for thee, to make you know yourselves and your own
weakness, that ye may know the Lord's strength and
power, and may trust in Him. Let the time past be
sufficient to every one, who in any thing hath been
lifted up in transgression out of the power of the Lord;
for He can bring down and abase the mighty, and lay
them in the dust of the earth. Therefore, all keep low
in His fear, that thereby ye may receive the secrets of
God and His wisdom, may know the shadow of the
Almighty, and sit under it in all tempests, storms, and
heats. For God is a God at hand, and the Most High
rules in the children of men. This is the word of the
Lord God unto you all; what the Light doth make manifest
and discover, as temptations, distractions, confusions;
do not look at these temptations, confusions, corruptions,
but at the Light which discovers them and
makes them manifest; and with the same Light you may
feel over them, to receive power to stand against them.
The same Light which lets you see sin and transgression,
will let you see the covenant of God, which blots out
your sin and transgression, which gives victory and
dominion over it, and brings into covenant with God.
For looking down at sin, corruption, and distraction,
ye are swallowed up in it; but looking at the Light,
which discovers them, ye will see over them. That will
give victory, and ye will find grace and strength; there
is the first step to peace. That will bring salvation; by
it ye may see to the beginning, and the 'Glory that was
with the Father before the world began'; and come to
know the Seed of God, which is the heir of the promise
of God, and of the world which hath no end; and which
bruises the head of the serpent, who stops people from
coming to God. That ye may feel the power of an endless
life, the power of God which is immortal, which
brings the immortal soul up to the immortal God, in
whom it doth rejoice. So in the name and power of the
Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty strengthen thee.

Oliver Cromwell, Vol IV., pp. 199, 200. Oliver Cromwell
died September 3d, 1658. This "waft" or whiff of
death which Fox felt was not the only forewarning of
his end which came to Friends. A letter was delivered
into Cromwell's hand a month before his death, which
contained these words: "If thou continueth in thy oppression,
the Lord will suddenly smite thee." See
Burrough's "Good Counsel and Advice Rejected by

of the Faith and Order owned and practiced in the
Congregational Churches in England: Agreed upon and

Harry Vane had become his most fearless opposer, and
an advocate of extreme republicanism. After the downfall
of Richard Cromwell, Vane had a brief return to
influence and power. In September, 1659, he was made
President of the Council, and was in this position the
executive head of the nation in civil affairs. This episode
must, therefore, be dated in the autumn of 1659.</p></div>

take away the occasion of wars, and so know a kingdom
which hath no end, and fight for that with spiritual

Singular and Plural; You to Many, and Thou to One:
Singular One, Thou; Plural Many, You, Wherein is
shewed forth by Grammar, or Scripture Examples, how
several Nations and People have made a distinction
between Singular and Plural, And First. In the former
part of this Book, Called the English Battle-Door, may
be seen how several People have spoken Singular and
Plural, As the Apharsathkites, The Tarpelites, The
Apharsites, The Archevites, The Babylonians, The

Temanites, The Naomites, The Shuites, The
Buzites, The Moabites, The Hevites, The Edomites,
The Philistines, The Amalekites, The Sodomites,
The Hittites, The Midianites, &amp;c. Also,
in this Book is set forth Examples of the Singular

Languages divided into distinct Battle-Doors, or Forms,
or Examples; English, Latine, Italian, Greek, Hebrew,
Caldec, Syriack, Arabick, Persiack, Ethiopick, Samaritan,
Coptick or Egyptick, Armenian, Saxon, Welch,
Mence, Cornish, French, Spanish, Portugal, High-Dutch,
Low Dutch, Danish, Bohemian, Slavonian, and
how Emperors and others have used the Singular Word
to One; and how the Word You (to one) came first from
the Pope. Likewise some examples, in the Polonian,
Lithvanian, Irish and East-Indian, Together with the
Singular and Plural Words thou and you, in Swedish,
Turkish, Muscovian and Curlandian tongues,&mdash;In the
latter part of this Book are contained several bad unsavoury

"Prester John's Country" was Abyssinia. Prester
John was a legendary Christian priest, who was believed
in the early Middle Ages to reign over this Eastern
country. About this time Catherine Evans and

at Malta, from which Fox secured their
release, through the influence of Lord D'Aubeny, a

mischiefs and dangers that may arise by certain persons
called Quakers, and others refusing to take oaths."
The act declared it "altogether unlawful and contrary
to the word of God" to refuse to take an oath, or to
persuade another person to refuse to do so. It further
made it an offense for more than five persons, "commonly
called Quakers," "to assemble in any place

Fox's style. The letter manifests a profound and beautiful
spirit, but the phraseology is none too clear. He

pen was busy during these weeks in jail, and many
epistles and documents were written. A Baptist
preacher, named Wiggan, who had been a great opponent
of Fox, was brought into straits over the oath
which he finally took. The episode furnishes this interesting
entry:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This Wiggan was poor, and while he was prisoner at
Lancaster he sent into the country, and got money
gathered for relief of the poor people of God in prison;
and many people gave freely, thinking it had been for
us, when indeed it was for himself. But when we heard
of it, we laid it upon him, and wrote into the country,
that Friends might let the people know the truth of the
matter, that it was not our manner to have collections
made for us, and that those collections were only for
Wiggan and another, a drunken preacher of his
society, who was so drunk, that once he lost his
breeches."</p></blockquote>

was on the extreme seaside of the castle and has been

broke down his wonderful constitution. He never again

more clearly than in his work of organizing the Society
which his ministry had drawn together. During his
long imprisonment many internal difficulties had
arisen, which showed that the Society was too loosely
organized for a permanent work in the world. The rest
of his life&mdash;twenty-four years&mdash;was mainly devoted to
this work of perfecting the system of meetings and
government, though his <em>ministry</em> meantime in no way
slackened. The first system of Discipline, printed in
1669 by his opponents, under the title, "Canons and
Institutions," was drawn up soon after the release from
Scarborough Castle.</p></div>

were a well-established institution. Norman Penney
has sent me an interesting extract from Barclay's "Letters
of the Early Friends," which traces the development
of the yearly meeting:
</p>
<p>
"There was a yearly meeting settled at Skipton in
Yorkshire for all the northern and southern countries,
... and then the yearly meeting was removed to
John Crooks, ... and afterwards the yearly meeting was
kept at Bailey, in Yorkshire, and likewise at Skipton,
in the year 1660. And from thence it was moved to
London the next year, where it hath been kept ever
since," p. 312 from a document said to have been by
George Fox, but only since 1672 has it been held in
London without intermission. The series of yearly
meeting minutes commences 23d of Third month, 1671.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_158_200" id="Footnote_158_200"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_200"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> As George Fox was too ill to travel, the meetings
for worship and for business were held at the house
where he was staying. At these meetings he gave much
valuable counsel. Here he first met with slavery and
dealt with it. "I desired them also that they would
cause their overseers to deal mildly and gently with
their negroes, and not use cruelty towards them, as the
manner of some hath been and is; and that after certain
years of servitude, they would make them free."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_159_201" id="Footnote_159_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_159_201"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> In order that it might be positively clear that he
"exalted Christ in all His offices," he wrote an extended
Letter to the Governor of Barbadoes. The Letter
takes the form of a declaration of faith and is often
referred to as an authoritative statement of the belief
of Friends. It was, however, not written for that purpose,
and it is not by any means a full statement of
their belief. It does not even mention the principle
which held the leading place in all Fox's teaching and
preaching. The Letter to the Governor was written to
clear Friends from false charges, and it dwells solely on
the points on which Fox is rumored to be unsound, or
charged with dangerous teaching. The earliest "declaration
of faith" of the Quakers was issued by Christopher
Holder, John Copeland and Richard Doudney,
from Boston prison in 1657. The earliest statement issued
in England was Richard Farnsworth's "Confession
and Profession of Faith in God," London, 1658.</p></div>

There are two Tinicum islands in the Delaware (it is
called "Dinidock" in the first edition of the Journal).
The crossing was probably made at the upper island,
which is just in front of what is now the city of Burlington,
though this would be hardly ninety miles from Middletown
Harbour, as he estimates. He then travels
down across the very country which Friends afterwards
settled under the leadership of William Penn. There
is evidence to show that the idea of forming in America
a colony of Friends originated with George Fox. We
learn from a letter of Josiah Coale, a Friend who had
travelled extensively among the Indians, that George
Fox had commissioned him to treat with the Susquehanna
Indians for the purchase of a strip of territory.
Fox's letter is not preserved, but Josiah Coale's answer
is among the Swarthmore MSS., and is as follows: "Dear
George,&mdash;As concerning Friends buying a piece of land
of the Susquehanna Indians, I have spoken of it to
them and told them what <em>thou said</em> concerning it, but
their answer was that there is no land that is habitable
or fit for situation beyond Baltimore's liberty [i. e., beyond
the domain of Lord Baltimore,] till they come to
or near the Susquehanna fort, and besides William Fuller,
who was the chief man amongst Friends with the
Indians ... is withdrawn at present, ... so that without
him little can be done at present with the Indians;
and besides, these Indians are at war with another nation
of Indians, who are very numerous, and it is doubted
by some that in a little space they will be so destroyed
that they will not be a people. Thine in the
truth,
</p>

<p><br />
<span class="smcap">Josiah Coale</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>
This letter was written in 1660, twelve years before
this American visit. About the same time William
Penn's thoughts were turning in the same direction.
Writing about Pennsylvania in 1681, he says: "This I
can say, that I had an <em>opening of joy</em> as to these parts
in the year 1661, at Oxford twenty years since." By
a purchase made through John Fenwick and Edward
Byllynge, Friends obtained possession of a great section
of New Jersey in 1674, the year after George Fox
arrived in England. There can be no doubt that his
thoughts were on future settlements here as he travelled
through what is now Pennsylvania and New
Jersey.</p></div>

of our company and help." Fox had just received a
message that his mother was in her last illness, and it

change appears. There is no cessation of activity, but
it is activity of a quieter sort. Only one important
mission journey falls in these years&mdash;the visit to Holyland
and Germany. Henceforth he makes his pen speak
for him. Epistles and books are the main results of
these fourteen years. The Journal grows dry and devoid
of dramatic interest, and our gleanings from it
will be few. He is much at Swarthmore or at Kingston,
near London, where Margaret Rous, a daughter

though the latter had a personal tilt with John Burnyeat
at Newport in 1671. After George Fox had left
Providence and had gone back down the Bay with his
companion, Nicholas Easton, governor of Rhode Island,
Roger Williams rowed to Newport with a challenge to
a debate. Fox, however, had already left the island,
and was well on his way toward Long Island. Williams
then wrote, what Fox elsewhere calls "Roger Williams's
'Book of Lyes,'" a book bearing the grimly
humorous title, "George Fox digged out of his Burrows,"
Boston, 1676. (See Publications of the Narragansett
Club, Vol. V., pp. xx.-xlv., Providence, 1872.)
Fox and Burnyeat reply to this "slanderous book" in
a sixty-five-page pamphlet entitled, "A New England
Fire Brand Quenched." Fox seemed not to know just
where the famous "apostle of soul liberty" lived, as he
says, "a priest of New England (or some colony thereabouts!)"</p></div>

man of considerable note. Sewell, the Quaker historian,
who had himself been a disciple of Abrahams, tells
us that in this discussion, which lasted five hours, the
latter maintained the position that "nobody nowadays
could be accepted as a messenger of God
unless he confirmed the same by miracle." (See
Sewell's "History of Friends," Vol. II., page 368,
edition of 1823. See, also, Barclay's "Religious
Societies of the Commonwealth," pages 174, 251.)
During his second visit to Holland, Fox had another
interview with the famous Mennonite which gives
an interesting side light on the penetrating power of
Fox's eyes, already noticed. "Before I left I went to
visit one Galenus Abrahams, a teacher of chief note
among the Mennonites, or Baptists. I had been with
him when I was in Holland about seven years before
and William Penn and George Keith had disputes with
him. He was then very high and shy, so that he would
not let me touch him, nor look upon him (by his good
will), but bid me 'Keep my eyes off him, for,' he said,
'they pierced him.' But now he was very loving and
tender, and confessed in some measure to truth; his
wife also and daughter were tender and kind, and we
parted from them very lovingly."</p></div>

in which are given many passages from the words
of sovereigns, both ancient and modern, in behalf of
liberty of conscience. The letter is an able and valuable
document, written, as the writer says, "in love to
thy immortal soul and for thy eternal good." It closes
with this postscript:
</p>
<p>
"Postscript.&mdash;'Blessed be the merciful, for they shall
obtain mercy.' And remember, O king, Justin Martyr's
two Apologies to the Roman emperors, in the defence
of the persecuted Christians; and that notable Apology,
which was written by Tertullian, upon the same subject;
which are not only for the Christian religion, but
against all persecution for religion."</p></div>

</p>
<p>
"Dear, suffering lambs, for the name and command
of Jesus; be valiant for His truth, and faithful, and ye
will feel the presence of Christ with you. Look at
Him who suffered for you, who hath bought you, and
will feed you; who saith, 'Be of good comfort, I have
overcome the world'; who destroys the devil and his
works, and bruises the serpent's head. I say, look to
Christ, your sanctuary, in whom ye have rest and peace.
To you it is given not only to believe, but to suffer for
His name's sake. They that will live godly in Christ
Jesus, shall suffer persecution by the ungodly professors
of Christ Jesus, who live out of Him. Therefore
be valiant for God's truth upon the earth, and look
above that spirit that makes you suffer, up to Christ,
who was before it was, and will be when it is gone."</p></div>
